Sarum<SEP>Michael Wise (1648–1687) was an English organist and composer. He sang as a child in the choir of the Chapel Royal and served as a countertenor in St George's Chapel, Windsor, from 1666 until, in 1668, he was appointed organist and choirmaster at <ENT>Sarum<ENT> . In 1676 he became a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal, and in the last year of his life was Master of the Children at St Paul's Cathedral.
Portland<SEP>During World War II several sections of the Jurassic Coast became the property of the Ministry of War. One of the Royal Navy's largest bases was at <ENT>Portland<ENT> , though it has since closed. A major army base at Bovington remains in use today. Large areas of land, including the coast between Lulworth Cove and Kimmeridge, are still only partially accessible; this includes the ghost village of Tyneham which was evacuated after being requisitioned by the army in 1943.
West Edmonton<SEP>Examples of amusement parks in shopping malls exist in <ENT>West Edmonton<ENT> , Pier 39 and Mall of America.
Bristol<SEP>Buses operate from the railway station to Axbridge, Cheddar, Wells, Burnham-on-Sea, and <ENT>Bristol<ENT> , as well as most parts of the town.
Abu Ghraib<SEP>The film depicts Yunis Khatayer Abbas, an Iraqi journalist who was detained by US troops in 2003 and later imprisoned at <ENT>Abu Ghraib<ENT> for nine months.  Although innocent, he was accused by American military officials of plotting to assassinate then British prime minister Tony Blair along with his two brothers.
Sarum<SEP>St Lawrence's Church at Stratford-sub-Castle is a Grade I listed Church of England parish church, situated to the north of Salisbury. It stands close to the abandoned settlement of <ENT>Sarum<ENT> and about 2 miles (3.2 km) north of Salisbury Cathedral.

Vancouver<SEP>In 1830, Ogden was sent north to establish a new HBC post named Fort Simpson near the mouth of the Nass River in British Columbia.  He also managed an outpost on the south coast of Alaska. In 1834 he was promoted to Chief Factor, HBC's highest field rank. He administered <ENT>Vancouver<ENT> in the late 1840s. There Ogden fought successfully against American fur competition and successfully negotiated with local native tribes, including the Cayuse.
Salamanca<SEP>From 1857, Complutense University was the only one in Spain authorised to confer the doctorate. This law remained in effect until 1954, when <ENT>Salamanca<ENT> joined in commemoration of its septecentenary. In 1970, the right was extended to all Spanish universities.
Ramstein<SEP>309th Airlift Squadron was the last USAF operational flying unit at Chièvres Air Base. It was attached to the 86th Operations Group at <ENT>Ramstein<ENT> , Germany.  It primarily operated Gulfstream V aircraft (Designated C-37A) providing executive airlift for senior personnel assigned to SHAPE and NATO headquarters.
Rock Island<SEP>The M198 howitzer is a medium-sized, towed 155mm artillery piece, developed for service with the United States Army and Marine Corps. It was commissioned to be a replacement for the WWII-era M114 155 mm howitzer. It was designed and prototyped at <ENT>Rock Island<ENT> in 1969 with firing tests beginning in 1970 and went into full production there in 1978. It entered service in 1979 and since then 1,600 units have been produced and put into operation.
Kilkenny<SEP>Richard was born at <ENT>Kilkenny<ENT> and was named in honour of the visiting King Richard II, who had joined his cousin, James Butler, 3rd Earl of Ormond, to campaign against the Irish.
Dachau<SEP>Serious tensions arose between ethnic Czechs and Germans during both world wars. During World War II, most of the town's ethnic German residents sided with the Nazis; the German-run town council renamed the main square (until then named after president T. G. Masaryk) after Adolf Hitler. World War II brought a rise in anti-semitism and attacks on the Jews that reflected what was happening in Germany. On Kristallnacht (10 November 1938), townspeople destroyed the synagogue. In March 1939, city police arrested 800 Jewish men, and had some deported to <ENT>Dachau<ENT> . During 1942–1943, ethnic Germans sent the remaining Jews to Theresienstadt and other German concentration camps in occupied Poland. Fewer than 300 of the town's Jews survived the Holocaust.
Oak Ridge nuclear facility<SEP>In 1966, Pavan accepted an invitation from <ENT>Oak Ridge nuclear facility<ENT> in Tennessee to establish a laboratory for further investigation on cellular genetics. In 1968, he accepted an invitation to become a tenured full professor at the University of Texas at Austin, in Austin, Texas. He returned to Brazil in 1975, and, after officially retiring from his post at the University of São Paulo, he accepted the position of full professor at the recently founded State University of Campinas, working as departmental chairman and dean of the Instituto de Biologia da Universidade Estadual de Campinas (Institute of Biology) until a second retirement. He is currently an emeritus professor at both universities.
Covent Garden<SEP>Amongst reasons often adduced for the dearth of productions in the 20th century were the scale of Meyerbeer's more ambitious works and the cost of mounting them, as well as the alleged lack of virtuoso singers capable of doing justice to Meyerbeer's demanding music. However, successful productions of some of the major operas at relatively small centres such as Strasbourg (L'Africaine, 2004) and Metz (Les Huguenots, 2004) showed that this conventional wisdom can be challenged. Since then, there have been highly successful new productions of Les Huguenots at major opera houses in France, Belgium and Germany. The Paris Opera opened a new production of Les Huguenots in September 2018, the first time since 1936 for the opera to be performed there. In December 2012, <ENT>Covent Garden<ENT> in London premiered its first performance of Robert le diable in 120 years. In 2013, Meyerbeer's original version of L'Africaine in a new critical edition by Jürgen Schläder was performed by Chemnitz Opera under the original title Vasco de Gama. The production was a success with audiences and critics and won the poll of German critics award presented by Opernwelt magazine annually as "Rediscovery of the year" in 2013. The critical edition was also used for a high-profile new production at the Deutsche Oper Berlin in October 2015. From 2015 onwards, new productions of Le prophète began to appear at some European opera houses.
Ohio<SEP>Sulzer served in the United States Army during the Vietnam War. He earned a bachelor's degree from <ENT>Ohio<ENT> and was awarded a law degree by Capital University Law School.
Cartmel<SEP>He died peacefully at Summerhill Nursing Home, Kendal, Cumbria in July 2007, with a funeral service at <ENT>Cartmel<ENT> followed by cremation at Lancaster.
Burgas<SEP>BH Air operated charter flights for Balkan Holidays Ltd the UK Tour Operator during Winter seasons to Sofia Airport (contract finished in April 2015) but to date continues with the Summer seasons to <ENT>Burgas<ENT> and Varna Airport. At the end of June 2015 the company started regular flights from Athens Airport to New York City on behalf of SkyGreece Airlines. It was planned but never started, that the company would start flying to Chicago as well. They also had plans also to start regular flights to Kuala Lumpur and Kolkata after they were chosen by the Bulgarian government to operate the two routes.
Winchester<SEP>Recordings include those by the Choir of <ENT>Winchester<ENT> ; the Tallis Scholars, The Cardinall's Musick, the National Youth Choir of Great Britain, the Oxford Camerata; the Choirs of King's and St John's Colleges, Cambridge; The Sixteen; The Clerkes of Oxenford; Huelgas Ensemble; Taverner Consort and Players; Philip Cave's Magnificat; and, the British male a cappella group, the King's Singers. This recording is particularly noteworthy, since the group is composed of just six men: all forty parts are performed by these six via multitracking. The Kronos Quartet has also recorded an instrumental version of the motet on their album Black Angels. Cellist Peter Gregson has also multitracked Spem in Alium, performing all 40 parts on one cello. I Fagiolini have recorded it alongside a 40 part motet by Alessandro Striggio, with continuo, cornetts and sackbuts.
Cherry Hill<SEP> <ENT>Cherry Hill<ENT> has hosted several professional golf tournaments, including the U.S. Open, U.S. Senior Open, U.S. Women's Open, PGA Championship and BMW Championship.
Ohio<SEP>The E.W. Scripps School of Journalism at <ENT>Ohio<ENT> gave the "Carr Van Anda Award" to recognize outstanding work by journalists during their careers.
Southwark<SEP>On 18 March 2018 the charity celebrated its 200th birthday and held a service at <ENT>Southwark<ENT> on 24 April, where Prince Michael of Kent spoke about his family's longstanding links with the charity.
Brookwood<SEP>On 20 March 1999 the grave of William Kenny received a new headstone in the Corps of Commissionaires plot at <ENT>Brookwood<ENT> , arranged by The Gordon Highlanders London Association (Lt Col. M.H. Burge). Kenny was buried in 1936 but unfortunately the original marker was lost and until this stone was placed, Kenny was not otherwise commemorated.
Cassino<SEP>Throughout his rule at Nocera, Jordan was on very good terms with the monastery of Cava. In the diploma of September 1111, he confirmed Abbot Peter's properties in his territory, delineating precisely their boundaries, and, along with some of his vassals, undertook to defend them. A few days later, in the presence of Sergius of Sorrento, among others, Jordan swore to protect the person of the abbot and several fortresses belonging to the abbey, including the strategic castle of Sant'Adiutore. In March 1114 Jordan organised a gathering of prominent Normans, including his brother, at Nocera in order to extract oaths from Robert of Eboli and Roger of San Severino to stop their hostile actions against Cava. In January 1115 he confirmed some goods to the monastery of San Massimo di Salerno, a dependency of Cava, which had been forced to take its claims to court against the citizens of Nocera. Jordan also made important concessions to the monastery of San Angelo in Formis, a dependency of <ENT>Cassino<ENT> , to which he even gave some of his own inherited land.
Dalkeith<SEP>He endeavoured to prevent a conflict by impressing on the king the necessity of caution and the danger of extreme measures against the rioters. He was, however, compelled to publish Charles's proclamation enforcing the use of the liturgy and forbidding hostile demonstrations on pain of treason (1638). This was followed by military measures in which Traquair assisted by secretly conveying munitions of war to <ENT>Dalkeith<ENT> . He was, however, obliged to surrender the place with the regalia to the Covenanters (March 1639).
Parafield<SEP>Arkaroola is the common name for the Arkaroola Wilderness Sanctuary, a wildlife sanctuary situated on 610 square kilometres (240 square miles) of freehold and pastoral lease land in South Australia.  It is located 700 kilometres (430 miles) north of the Adelaide city centre in the Northern Flinders Ranges, adjacent to the Vulkathunha-Gammon Ranges National Park and the Mawson Plateau.  The most common way to get there is by car, but air travel can be chartered from <ENT>Parafield<ENT> , Adelaide Airport or Aldinga Airfield.  It was used as a location set the 2002 film The Tracker.
Springfield<SEP>In terms of war materiel, Massachusetts, as a leading center of industry and manufacturing, was poised to become a major producer of munitions and supplies. The most important source of armaments in Massachusetts was <ENT>Springfield<ENT> of the United States Department of War.
Abu Ghraib<SEP>On 17 August 2003, Dana was shot and killed by a US Army soldier as he attempted to film a tank patrol outside <ENT>Abu Ghraib<ENT> in Baghdad during the Iraq War. The soldier mistook his camera for a rocket launcher and fired, hitting Dana four times in the chest. Though the soldiers then realized their mistake and called for medical aid, Dana died on the scene. He was the second Reuters cameraman to be killed in the conflict, and the seventeenth journalist to be killed.
Kilkenny<SEP>The eighth Baronet, Sir Robert, died without legitimate issue, so the Dunmore property was bequeathed to his eldest (illegitimate) son, while the Baronetcy was inherited by John Staples' eldest son Thomas who thus became the ninth Baronet and reunited the title with the Lissan Estate. Sir Thomas Staples Q.C. was a notable lawyer and was appointed Queen's Advocate in Ireland in 1845. He married Catherine Hawkins, another heiress. He purchased the largest town house on Merrion Square in Dublin (now the Irish Architectural Archive) and made several significant additions to Lissan House, most notably the large ballroom built to take advantage of views over the water gardens. No expense was spared on the construction of this room which was fitted with an early central heating system, was double glazed and which had sprung floorboards to aid dancing. The curious dovetail joints of the floor boarding are quite remarkable and it is clear that the timbers were set with neither nail nor screw. The room was decorated in a striking oriental scheme of scarlet and black and was decorated with vastly expensive hand-painted Chinese wallpaper possibly originally purchased by Sir Thomas' sister Grace, Marchioness of Ormonde for <ENT>Kilkenny<ENT> . Small portions of this wallpaper survive today, touched up by the last owner.
Winchester<SEP>The choir performs major concerts three times a year. Its main venue is Southampton Guildhall. It also regularly performs in <ENT>Winchester<ENT> and the Turner Sims Concert Hall, Southampton.
Carnarvon<SEP>As a static structure, castles could often be avoided. Their immediate area of influence was about 400 metres (1,300 ft) and their weapons had a short range even early in the age of artillery. However, leaving an enemy behind would allow them to interfere with communications and make raids. Garrisons were expensive and as a result often small unless the castle was important. Cost also meant that in peacetime garrisons were smaller, and small castles were manned by perhaps a couple of watchmen and gate-guards. Even in war, garrisons were not necessarily large as too many people in a defending force would strain supplies and impair the castle's ability to withstand a long siege. In 1403, a force of 37 archers successfully defended <ENT>Carnarvon<ENT> against two assaults by Owain Glyndŵr's allies during a long siege, demonstrating that a small force could be effective.
Chernobyl<SEP>Wels have also been observed thriving in the cooling pond of the <ENT>Chernobyl<ENT> . Although believed by tourists to have mutated into large sizes as a result of radioactive fallout, in reality the fish are growing to such proportions due to the absence of humans, hunting and fishing having been outlawed in the exclusion zone following the accident.
Bec<SEP>It was Warelwast who told Anselm in 1103 that the king would not permit his return to England. This came after a failed joint mission by Warelwast and Anselm to Paschal attempting to resolve the dispute between Henry and the archbishop over the king's investiture of bishops, a dispute generally known as the Investiture Controversy. It is quite likely that the king had given instructions that if the mission failed, Warelwast was to inform Anselm that he should only to return to England if he agreed with the king's position in the dispute. In 1106 Warelwast was the king's negotiator in the discussions that led to the settlement of the Investiture Controversy in England. The king ultimately lost little, relinquishing the right to give the actual symbols of episcopal authority to a newly elected bishop in return for continuing to receive homage from the bishops. Early in 1106 Warelwast was sent to <ENT>Bec<ENT> , where Anselm was residing in exile, to inform him of the settlement and deliver to the archbishop the king's invitation to return to England. In May 1107 Warelwast acted as the king's envoy at Paschal's council at Troyes, where Paschal was attempting to secure support for Bohemond of Antioch's proposed campaign against Byzantium. Warelwast probably relayed to the pope the news that King Henry would make no contribution to Bohemond's efforts.
Cassino<SEP>Leo Marsicanus (meaning "of the Marsi") or Ostiensis (meaning "of Ostia"), also known as Leone dei Conti di Marsi (1046, Marsica – 1115/7, Ostia), was a nobleman and monk of <ENT>Cassino<ENT> around 1061 and Italian cardinal from the 12th century.

Mystic<SEP>Joseph Conrad is an iron-hulled sailing ship, originally launched as Georg Stage in 1882 and used to train sailors in Denmark. After sailing around the world as a private yacht in 1934 she served as a training ship in the United States, and is now a museum ship at <ENT>Mystic<ENT> in Connecticut.
Brookwood<SEP>All-Hallows-the-Great itself was demolished in 1894 and the united parishes were in turn joined  with that of St Michael Paternoster Royal under the  Union of Benefices Act 1860. In 1896 many bodies were disinterred from the churchyard and reburied at <ENT>Brookwood<ENT> . The last physical evidence of the existence  of  All-Hallows-the-Less,  an old watch house, was destroyed during the Second World War.
Saint Hill<SEP>In April 2012, the band lent their support to the Multi-Marathon for a Drug-Free UK, a 130-mile run organised by the Church of Scientology [3] from London to Brighton in Crawley, West Sussex, not too far from <ENT>Saint Hill<ENT> , a site regarded as the British headquarters of the Church.
West Edmonton<SEP>The largest enclosed shopping mall from 1986 to 2004 was the 350,000 m (3,800,000 sq ft) <ENT>West Edmonton<ENT> in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Currently, the largest mall in the world is the New South China Mall in Dongguan, China with a gross floor area of 892,000 m (9,600,000 sq ft). The world's second-largest shopping mall is the Golden Resources Mall in Beijing, China with a gross floor area of 680,000 m (7,300,000 sq ft). SM Megamall in the Philippines, is the world's third-largest at 542,980 m (5,844,600 sq ft) of gross floor area. The fourth largest shopping mall in the world is SM City North EDSA in Quezon City, Philippines with a gross floor area of 504,900 m (5,435,000 sq ft) and the fifth largest shopping mall is 1 Utama in Malaysia at 465,000 m (5,010,000 sq ft) of gross floor area.
Charing Cross<SEP>William Foyle was one of the leading London booksellers of the 20th century. In 1903 he opened his first bookshop with his brother Gilbert and by the late 1920s the business had grown so rapidly that their bookstore in <ENT>Charing Cross<ENT> held a stock of four million volumes on over thirty miles of bookshelves, and the name of Foyle had become synonymous with bookselling in London. His vision for the business was a bookshop for the world - for every one from any station in life - "The People's Bookshop". His inspiration was James Lackington's late 18th century "Temple of Muses" at Chiswell Street, London.
Oak Ridge nuclear facility<SEP>Dr. Witold Nazarewicz (born 1954) is a nuclear physicist born in Warsaw, Poland, currently teaching at Michigan State University. He is also the scientific director of the Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility at <ENT>Oak Ridge nuclear facility<ENT> . He earned his doctorate in physics from the Warsaw Institute of Technology in 1981 and holds the title of professor ordinarius in Poland.
West Edmonton<SEP>In 1986 World Waterpark was open in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada at <ENT>West Edmonton<ENT> . It is in 2016 the largest indoor water park in North America.
San Siro<SEP>At Milan, Sacchi again faced problems of credibility. The press argued that such an inadequate player could never go on to be a successful coach, and that even Berlusconi – who had played football at amateur level – was probably a better player. Sacchi, however, coined a witty term in response: "I never realised that in order to become a jockey you have to have been a horse first." Sacchi was an instant success at <ENT>San Siro<ENT> , leading Milan to its first Serie A title in nine years in his debut season, following up the league title with a Supercoppa Italiana in 1988.
Darlington<SEP>The 2006 Dodge Charger 500, the 50th running of the event that dates to the 1957 Rebel 300 , was held on May 13, 2006 at <ENT>Darlington<ENT> as the eleventh race of the 2006 NASCAR Nextel Cup season. Kasey Kahne won the pole.
Rugby<SEP>In Hughes' 1857 book, Flashman (a relatively minor character) is portrayed as a notorious bully at <ENT>Rugby<ENT> who persecutes Tom Brown, and who is finally expelled for drunkenness. Fraser decided to write Flashman's memoirs, in which the school bully would be identified with an "illustrious Victorian soldier" experiencing many 19th-century wars and adventures and rising to high rank in the British Army, acclaimed as a great soldier, while remaining "a scoundrel, a liar, a cheat, a thief, a coward—and, oh yes, a toady." Fraser's Flashman is an antihero who often runs from danger in the novels. Nevertheless, through a combination of luck and cunning, he usually ends each volume acclaimed as a hero.
Blarney<SEP>In 1952, he married Mary Penelope Colthurst, daughter of Sir Richard St John Jefferyes Colthurst, 8th Baronet. She had divorced first husband, Brigadier Godfrey John Hamilton, in 1942.  She inherited <ENT>Blarney<ENT> , and she died 1975.
Wembley<SEP>He made his debut for Manchester City in the 2–1 defeat to Hull City. Three days later, he made his first start for City against Bolton Wanderers, where he assisted Emmanuel Adebayor through a long ball in the 2–0 victory. He scored his first goal for the club against Burnley in their 6–1 win on 3 April 2010. On 9 June 2010, Vieira agreed to a one-year extension to his contract, which kept him at Eastlands until the summer of 2011. On 11 September 2010, he started his first game in his second season for the club and went on to score the equalizing goal against Blackburn Rovers before being substituted in the 65th minute. On 18 January 2011, he scored his second goal of the season in Manchester City's 4–2 third round replay against Leicester City. This was his 50th appearance in the competition. He continued his good run in the FA Cup by scoring the first two goals, during their 5–0 win in the Fourth round replay against Notts County and was awarded Man of the Match honours. He was praised for how well he linked up with Aleksandar Kolarov. Vieira also scored in the Premier League on 3 April 2011 against Sunderland, having come on as a substitute for Adam Johnson in the 66th minute. He scored no less than a minute later, having touched the ball into the goal. He made a late substitute appearance in May 2011, as Manchester City won the FA Cup with a 1–0 win over Stoke City at <ENT>Wembley<ENT> .
Chiswick<SEP>On 20 May, a second colour film was made at <ENT>Chiswick<ENT> in west London. The Beatles mimed to the song, and they were shown in and around the conservatory in the grounds of the house. The clip was first broadcast in black and white on BBC-TV's Top of the Pops on 2 June. The 20 May promo clip was included in the Beatles' 2015 video compilation 1, and both the 19 May colour film and the 20 May film were included in the three-disc versions of the compilation, titled 1+.
Solovki<SEP>On May 7, 1775, Empress Catherine II issued a direct order that the Zaporozhian Sich was to be destroyed. On June 5, 1775, Russian artillery and infantry surrounded the Sich and razed it to the ground. The Russian troops disarmed the Cossacks, and the treasury archives were confiscated. The Koshovyi Otaman, Petro Kalnyshevsky, was arrested and incarcerated in exile at <ENT>Solovki<ENT> . This marked the end of the Zaporozhian Cossacks.
Los Alamos<SEP>Project PACER, carried out at <ENT>Los Alamos<ENT> (LANL) in the mid-1970s, explored the possibility of a fusion power system that would involve exploding small hydrogen bombs (fusion bombs)—or, as stated in a later proposal, fission bombs—inside an underground cavity. As an energy source, the system is the only fusion power system that could be demonstrated to work using existing technology. However it would also require a large, continuous supply of nuclear bombs, and contemporary economics studies demonstrated that these could not be produced at a competitive price compared to conventional energy sources.
Oak Ridge atomic plant<SEP>Experiments that make use of this science include scattering experiments in which neutrons directed and then scattered from a sample are to be detected. Facilities include the ISIS neutron source at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, the Spallation Neutron Source at <ENT>Oak Ridge atomic plant<ENT> , and the Spallation Neutron Source (SINQ) at the Paul Scherrer Institute, in which the neutrons are produced by spallation reaction, and the traditional research reactor facilities in which neutrons are produced during fission of uranium isotopes. Noteworthy among the various neutron detection experiments is the trademark experiment of the European Muon Collaboration, first performed at CERN and now termed the "EMC experiment." The same experiment is performed today with more sophisticated equipment to obtain more definite results related to the original EMC effect.
South Bank<SEP>In 1951 she married Holwell Bender, but they later divorced. Together they painted the Television Pavilion Mural, at <ENT>South Bank<ENT> for the Festival of Britain.
Westminster<SEP>In 1529 Wolsey was stripped of his government office and property, including his magnificently expanded residence of Hampton Court, which Henry took to replace <ENT>Westminster<ENT> as his own main London residence. However, Wolsey was permitted to remain Archbishop of York. He travelled to Yorkshire for the first time in his career, but at Cawood in North Yorkshire, he was accused of treason and ordered to London by Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland. In great distress, he set out for the capital with his personal chaplain, Edmund Bonner. He fell ill on the journey, and died at Leicester on 29 November 1530, around the age of 57. Just before his death he reputedly spoke these words:
Glastonbury<SEP>The second "Life" of St. Gildas was written by Caradoc of Llancarfan, a friend of Geoffrey of Monmouth and his Norman patrons. However, Llancarfan's work is most probably historically inaccurate, as his hagiographies tend towards the fictitious, rather than the strictly historical. Llancarfan's "Life" was written in the 12th century, and includes many elements of what have come to be known as mythical pseudo-histories, involving King Arthur, Guinevere, and <ENT>Glastonbury<ENT> , leading to the general opinion that this "life" is less historically accurate than the earlier version. For example, according to the dates in the Annales Cambriae, Gildas would have been a contemporary of King Arthur: however, Gildas' work never mentions Arthur by name, even though he gives a history of the Britons, and states that he was born in the same year as the Battle of Badon Hill, in which Arthur is supposed to have vanquished the Saxons.
Dinas<SEP>She learnt to excavate with Leslie Alcock at <ENT>Dinas<ENT> whilst still at school.
Nauen<SEP>In 1904 he began to work for the  "Gesellschaft für drahtlose Telegraphie m.b.H." (Company for Wireless Telegraphy Ltd.), the later Telefunken, and was sent to Saint Petersburg. After the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War he acquired a contract for the radio equipment of the Russian Pacific squadron. He was involved in the planning of a Telefunken worldwide transmitting system and the construction of <ENT>Nauen<ENT> , which provided wireless communication with the United States via the Sayville Transmitter station and with the German colonies like the Kamina Transmitter in Togo.
Stirling<SEP>On 14 December 1444, at <ENT>Stirling<ENT> , he was betrothed to Annabella, youngest daughter of King James I of Scotland (d. 1437) and sister of King James II of Scotland. The marriage never took place and the betrothal was annulled in 1456.
Hays<SEP>Commercial bison hunters also emerged at this time. Military forts often supported hunters, who would use their civilian sources near their military base. Though officers hunted bison for food and sport, professional hunters made a far larger impact in the decline of bison population. Officers stationed in <ENT>Hays<ENT> and Wallace even had bets in their "buffalo shooting championship of the world", between "Medicine Bill" Comstock and "Buffalo Bill" Cody. Some of these hunters would engage in mass bison slaughter in order to make a living.
Tintagel<SEP>Trigg is mentioned by name during the 7th century, as "Pagus Tricurius", "land of three war hosts". It was to the north of Cornwall, and included Bodmin Moor, Bodmin and the district to the west and north of the Moor. The high incidence of imported pottery from the period found at <ENT>Tintagel<ENT> suggests that this was an area of high significance, where war bands from the region may have congregated.
Nyker<SEP>The best known surviving round churches of Denmark (Danish: rundkirke) are on the island of Bornholm. They were built in the twelfth century, but exact dates are not known. They have been modified repeatedly. Their significance lies in their fortress-like outer-walls with large buttresses, which bear the weight of a round barrel vault along with a central pillar.  All the round churches of Bornholm, except for <ENT>Nyker<ENT> , are fortified churches. The central pillar is often decorated with a painted frieze. Originally, the round churches had flat roofs with battlements (for defence). Their characteristic conical roofs were first added in the late Middle Ages. The weight of these roofs rests on the outer walls, making strong external supports necessary, which are especially distinctive on the church of Østerlars. The first three churches in the list below have three stories, the Ny Kirke has two stories. The upper stories are only accessible by narrow passages and served the local people as a refuge against pirate raids.
Whistler<SEP>Mark Abma (born March 3, 1980) is a professional freeskier from <ENT>Whistler<ENT> , British Columbia. He has won numerous awards, including the Powder Video Award for Best Male Performance in 2007 and 2005. Abma was first known as a mogul and park skier, but moved on to the back country and heliskiing later in his career. He has been featured in many extreme skiing movies.
Stone Mountain<SEP>Kensington is mainly a park-and-ride train station for commuters heading into Atlanta. This station serves unincorporated communities such as Decatur, <ENT>Stone Mountain<ENT> , Tucker, and Lithonia, as well as the cities of Stonecrest and Clarkston.
Glamis<SEP>The seat of the chief of Clan Lyon is at <ENT>Glamis<ENT> in Angus, Scotland.
NYC<SEP>Westchester County Airport is the closest commercial airport to Darien, with direct service to Chicago, Charlotte, Atlanta, West Palm Beach, Fort Myers, Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, Tampa, Pittsburgh, Detroit, and Washington DC. Seasonal service also exists to Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard, Hyannis, Vero Beach and Provincetown. It takes approximately 25 minutes to drive to from the town's center. This is followed by LaGuardia Airport in Queens, New York, a 45-minute drive from Darien. <ENT>NYC<ENT> in Queens, New York, is the closest major international airport, a one-hour+ drive.

Southwark<SEP>Thomson was consecrated as a bishop by Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, in <ENT>Southwark<ENT> on 3 July 2008 and installed as Bishop of Huntingdon in Ely Cathedral on 17 October that year. During a lengthy vacancy in neighbouring Suffolk's diocesan see (while that diocese had no suffragan) from 20 October 2013 to 7 May 2015, he was also the Acting Bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich. He retired on 30 September 2018.
Gard<SEP>Mixtures of calcined lime and finely rounded, active aluminosilicate materials were pioneered and developed as inorganic binders in the Ancient world. Architectural remains of the Minoan civilization on Crete have shown evidence of the combined use of slaked lime and additions of finely ground potsherds for waterproof renderings in baths, cisterns and aqueducts. Evidence of the deliberate use of volcanic materials such as volcanic ashes or tuffs by the ancient Greeks dates back to at least 500–400 BC, as uncovered at the ancient city of Kameiros, Rhodes. In subsequent centuries the practice spread to the mainland and was eventually adopted and further developed by the Romans. The Romans used volcanic pumices and tuffs found in neighbouring territories, the most famous ones found in Pozzuoli (Naples), hence the name pozzolan, and in Segni (Latium). Preference was given to natural pozzolan sources such as German trass, but crushed ceramic waste was frequently used when natural deposits were not locally available. The exceptional lifetime and preservation conditions of some of the most famous Roman buildings such as the Pantheon or <ENT>Gard<ENT> constructed using pozzolan-lime mortars and concrete testify both to the excellent workmanship achieved by Roman engineers and to the durable properties of the binders they used.
Salisbury<SEP>He was buried at the Church of St John the Baptist, Frome, where his crypt can still be seen. He is remembered in the Church of England with a Lesser Festival on 8 June. He is also commemorated with a statue in niche 177 on the West Front of <ENT>Salisbury<ENT> .
San Siro<SEP>Williams was born in Reading but qualified to play for Wales through his father. He made seven international appearances during his first spell with Reading, including one at home to Moldova in 1995 alongside fellow Reading player Lee Nogan. Five more caps followed whilst at Wolverhampton Wanderers, including scoring his first international goal during a 2–1 win over Denmark, and in November 2002 he received his first international call-up for three years when he was selected for a squad to take on Azerbaijan. On 26 May 2003 Williams played the full 90 minutes as Wales lost 2–0 against the USA in an international friendly at the Spartan Stadium in San Jose, California, his first international start for four years. He was an unused substitute for a number of matches including an away defeat to Italy in <ENT>San Siro<ENT> , while he missed the play-off with Russia through injury.
Tredegar<SEP>The Eagle Foundry of Miles Greenwood in Cincinnati, Ohio produced 14 bronze M1841 12-pounder howitzers for the US Army in 1861–62. The Western Foundry of William D. Marshall and Co. of St. Louis, Missouri delivered 16 bronze M1841 12-pounder howitzers to the US Army. Several foundries in the Confederacy manufactured an estimated 118 bronze and 66 cast iron 12-pounder howitzers during the American Civil War. Leading all producers was <ENT>Tredegar<ENT> which delivered 42 bronze and 30 cast iron 12-pounder howitzers. Other Confederate producers of this weapon were Quinby and Robinson (43), T. M. Brennan (26), Noble Brothers (14), Leeds (9), John Clark (7), Washington Foundry (7), Wolff (3), A. B. Reading (2), and Skates (1).
Habbaniya<SEP>The Levies distinguished themselves in May 1941 during the Anglo-Iraqi War and were also used in other theatres of the Second World War after 1942.

Lambeth<SEP>Nayed is one of the leading Muslim figures in the field of inter-faith relations, and has been involved in various inter-faith initiatives since 1987, including A Common Word Between Us and You, of which he was one of the original signatories. Nayed was part of the Muslim delegation at the seminal Common Word bilateral meetings between Muslims and Christians at the Vatican, <ENT>Lambeth<ENT> , Cambridge, Yale, and Georgetown. In 2006 when Pope Benedict XVI made controversial comments on Islam in Regensburg, Germany, Nayed was one of the 138 Muslim scholars who drafted a letter inviting Catholic-Muslim dialogue. Nayed also took part in a conference of clerics who reinterpreted the 14th-century scholar Ibn Taymiyya's celebrated fatwa on jihad, arguing radical Islamists who use it to justify killing are misguided.
Fort York<SEP>After their foray into the United States market, Thrush Hermit returned north to release their final album, Clayton Park, on Sonic Unyon in 1999. The album was a critical success, and was nominated for a Juno Award. Thrush Hermit performed as part of Humble & Fred Fest at <ENT>Fort York<ENT> in Toronto, and at the Horseshoe Tavern in 1999, but made plans to disband in September that year. The band had signed up for the triple-headliner "Front Man War Tour" alongside The Flashing Lights and Local Rabbits, but had to back out because of Plaskett's health.  Once he recovered, the band embarked on their own farewell tour of Canada, in December 1999, and then disbanded.
Southwark<SEP>In July 1949, Fleming's name was put forward for the position of Bishop of Portsmouth.

Oak Ridge<SEP>During the first phase of the cleanup, known as the time-critical phase, over 3.5 million cubic yards were removed within a year of the spill. This phase allowed the removal of ash from the river to be accelerated by 75% over original expectations. During this phase, the ash was safely transported to a permanent, lined, and leachate collecting facility in Perry County, Alabama called Arrowhead landfill. The Emory River was reopened in late spring 2010. The time-critical phase removed 90% of the ash located in the Emory River. The next phase, which began in August 2010, removed the remaining ash from the Swan Pond Embayment of Watts Bar Reservoir. About 500,000 cubic yards of material, which mixed with the remains of leaked material from atomic energy production operations at <ENT>Oak Ridge<ENT> during the Cold War, was left in the rivers. The final phase of the cleanup consisted of assessments on the health and environmental effects of leaving this ash in the waterways. The cleanup was completed in 2015, and cost approximately $1.134 billion. In January 2017, the EPA announced that the ecosystems impacted by the spill had returned to conditions prior to the spill.

Southampton<SEP>With the help of her lady-in-waiting, Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden, Victoria wrote an unpublished memoir, held in the Mountbatten archive at <ENT>Southampton<ENT> , which remains an interesting source for royal historians. A selection of Queen Victoria's letters to Victoria have been published with a commentary by Richard Hough and an introduction by Victoria's granddaughter, Patricia Mountbatten.
Arad<SEP>The fort was constructed in 1840 although its origins likely come from a Portuguese fortification from the 16th century. An analysis of artefacts from the fort by an excavation team from Oxford Brookes University have suggested the site may have been first occupied from the Ummayad or early Abbasid era. There was also evidence of the site periodically being submerged underwater. The rectangular fort with four circular towers was built by Abdullah bin Ahmed Al Khalifa and served as a sister fort to <ENT>Arad<ENT> , guarding the passageway of Muharraq Bay. In 1868, the fort was destroyed by British warships intervening in the Qatari–Bahraini War.

NYC<SEP>The Taiwanese airline China Airlines provides private bus service to <ENT>NYC<ENT> from Parsippany to feed its flight to Taipei, Taiwan.
Darlington<SEP>Rookie Scott Hansen was tabbed as the new driver of the 52, and Oakwood Homes became the team's new sponsor. Hansen qualified for every race and had three top-tens when Schrader replaced him in the final race of the year, where he crashed out. Hansen still finished 2nd in the NASCAR Rookie of the Year standings and eighteenth in points. The 52 team went back to part-time racing after picking up a Federated Auto Parts sponsorship in 2000, with Schrader sharing the ride with Lyndon Amick, who had a second-place run at Indianapolis Raceway Park. Schrader and Amick continued to run part-time in 2001, with Schrader himself posting a second-place finish at <ENT>Darlington<ENT> . During 2001 and 2002, KSR ran in the Busch Series again in the No. 07 Chevy with Schrader attempting a total of three races, and Michael Vergers failing to qualify in his attempt. In 2002, Wallace returned to the team as co-driver, replacing Amick. The two would combine for twelve starts and five top-ten finishes. Schrader ran eleven races in 2003, and Wallace four, with four top-tens. Wallace began the 2004 season with a third-place finish, before Schrader took over for the rest of the runs for the years. He had four top-tens and a pole at Bristol Motor Speedway. He made nine more starts in 2005, but had only one top-ten finish.

Ramstein<SEP>With the transfer of the interceptors and no previously qualified aircrew or maintenance personnel assigned, the 181st went through a year of transition to its new mission. The squadron achieved operational status in the KC-97 in eight months.  The previous "normal" time for similar conversions was two years.  In 1966 the squadron began a rotational deployment to <ENT>Ramstein<ENT> in support of Operation Creek Party, which provided United States Air Forces Europe an air refueling capability.  The Creek Party deployment rotations lasted until 1976, and over the decade the squadron saw millions of pounds of jet fuel off-loaded and millions of miles flown, all accident free.  In 1976 the squadron's gaining command became Strategic Air Command, the Air Force's single manager of refueling assets.  However, the Air National Guard had begun retiring its KC-97s and by 1978 all had left the inventory.
Lahore<SEP>"Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya" ("Why should I be afraid to be in love?") is a song from the famous Indian movie Mughal-e-Azam (1960), which was directed by K. Asif.

Rosemont<SEP>The "Hey Cruel World... Tour" began at the end of April, which was interspersed with two co-headlining tours: "Twins of Evil" with Rob Zombie and "Masters of Madness" with Alice Cooper. The former tour received significant media attention when a feud developed between Manson and Zombie, culminating in a series of on-stage insults. It began after Manson apologized to the audience at Chicago's <ENT>Rosemont<ENT> on Twitter for not performing "The Beautiful People", and instructed the audience to "sing it in between Zombie songs, his band has already played it"—a reference to Zombie's band containing two former members of Marilyn Manson: John 5 and Ginger Fish. The row escalated in Clarkston when Manson accused Zombie of deliberately cutting into his set time. Zombie responded during his set by yelling obscenities at Manson.
Arecibo<SEP>In 2002, Kreusa was detected by radar from <ENT>Arecibo<ENT> at a distance of 1.67 AU. The resulting data yielded an effective diameter of 150±21 km.

Auschwitz<SEP>On the day of the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, Chorzów was taken by Nazi Germany. Polish irregulars, mainly Silesian uprising veterans and Scouts, put up resistance to the regular German forces for three days, most of them were  murdered in mass executions. Polish property was confiscated, and Chorzów (with the balance of Polish Silesia) was promptly re-incorporated into German Silesia (Preußische Provinz Schlesien, from 1941 Oberschlesien); the Upper Silesian industry being one the pillars of the Nazi Germany war effort. There were several enforced labor camps in Chorzów and, in years 1944–1945, two branches of <ENT>Auschwitz<ENT> . Chorzów was occupied by Soviet Red Army in January 1945 with the subsequent persecution of many ethnic Polish Silesians and Germans.
Oak Ridge<SEP>A platform employing three omni wheels in a triangular configuration is generally called Kiwi Drive.  The Killough platform is similar; so named after Stephen Killough's work with omnidirectional platforms at <ENT>Oak Ridge<ENT> .  Killough's 1994 design used pairs of wheels mounted in cages at right angles to each other and thereby achieved holonomic movement without using true omni wheels.
Darlington<SEP>The first Speedway Division race was held at <ENT>Darlington<ENT> and was won by Buck Baker with a Cadillac engine.

Brookfield<SEP>She was caught in May 1955 in Baoxing, Sichuan, and moved to the Beijing Zoo in June. In May 1957, Kliment Voroshilov made a request for a panda for the Moscow Zoo during his visit to China, and she was sent to Moscow with another panda in the same month. However, the attempts to mate them were unsuccessful due to sexual imprinting as a result of being reared by human keepers. The Russians suspected that both pandas were male, and as a result, the Soviets returned Chi Chi to China in exchange for another panda in January 1958. In May of the same year, the Austrian animal broker, Heini Demmer, acquired Chi Chi from Beijing Zoo in exchange for an impressive collection of African hoofstock and brought the animal back to Moscow Zoo. After resting for a week, the panda journeyed to Tierpark Berlin, the zoo in East Berlin. By then, Chi Chi had already been sold to <ENT>Brookfield<ENT> in Illinois, United States. However, the Treasury Department stepped in and announced that the US trade embargo on goods from the People's Republic of China extended even to pandas. Chi Chi was thus refused entry to the USA.
Brookwood<SEP>He is buried in <ENT>Brookwood<ENT> near Woking with his wife Anna Maria (died 1918) and his daughter Evelyn Margaret Bullen (1888-1910). A memorial plaque dedicated to him is in the church of St Peter and St Paul in Shoreham where he was the priest from 1888 to 1896.

Dachau<SEP>Both denominations cooperated with many illegal organizations and made funds available, for instance, to save Jewish children. Many priests and ministers were arrested and deported; some died, such as father Titus Brandsma, a professor of philosophy and an early outspoken critic of Nazism, who eventually succumbed to illness in <ENT>Dachau<ENT> , and Father Raskin, a priest in the CICM Missionaries, who operated under the codename Leopold Vindictive 200 and was beheaded by the Gestapo on 18 October 1943. Monseigneur De Jong, archbishop of Utrecht, was a steadfast leader of the Catholic community and a clear but wise opponent of the German occupiers. The Catholic stance on the protection of converted Jews, amongst others Edith Stein, a philosopher who was then also a nun in a Dutch convent, led to special prosecution of those Jews, sister Stein being deported. After the war, captured documents showed that the Germans feared the role of the churches, especially when Catholics and Protestants worked together.

Dachau<SEP>The Kowalski faction moved from Płock to Felicjanów. This village is the headquarters of the Catholic Church of the Mariavites, which has about 3,000 members. The denomination confirmed all the decisions of Kowalski and introduced the public cult of Kozłowska, the Mateczka, the Spouse of Christ and new Redemptrix of the world. Its doctrine has moved beyond that originally encouraged by the foundress. The church is insular and does not participate in the ecumenical movement. Kowalski died in <ENT>Dachau<ENT> during World War II. His successor was his wife, Bishop Maria Izabela Wiłucka-Kowalska. From 1946 to 2005, the head of the church was Bishop Maria Rafael Wojciechowski [pl]. He was succeeded in 2005 by Bishop Maria Beatrycze Szulgowicz [pl].
Eureka<SEP>Eventually, Newson found a teaching position in 1913 at Washburn College in Kansas.  Newson was one of eight Washburn faculty members to sign a petition defending a political science professor fired because of his political views. All of the signers left Washburn within a year or two, including Newson, who became department head at <ENT>Eureka<ENT> in her native Illinois until her retirement in 1942.
San Siro<SEP>Zárate immediately endeared himself to the Lazio faithful, scoring twice in his Serie A debut against Cagliari and dedicating the second to the Lazio supporters. He also scored on his home debut, with a left-footed strike from outside the penalty area against Sampdoria. This rich goalscoring form continued with Zárate scoring once against Milan at <ENT>San Siro<ENT> , twice against Torino and another against Siena. However, by mid-season, Zárate hit a dip in form and found himself being substituted for captain Tommaso Rocchi, who was returning to form following serious injury.
Portland<SEP>In July 1908 Doon entered refit and had a new propeller shaft fitted at Sheerness Dockyard, returning to the Channel Fleet destroyer Flotilla at the end of September. On the night of 2/3 March 1909, Doon, which had set off from <ENT>Portland<ENT> with the destroyer Fawn to escort the Royal yacht Alexandra from Dover to Calais, collided with the steam trawler Halcyon. The trawler sank, with all of her crew rescued by Doon, while Doon's bow was badly damaged, forcing her to put into Portsmouth for repair. In April 1909 she was assigned to the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla on its formation at Harwich. She remained until displaced by a Basilisk-class destroyer by May 1912. She was assigned to the 5th Destroyer Flotilla of the 2nd Fleet with a nucleus crew.
Stirling<SEP>In the records of the Scottish exchequer he is called the 'French Leech' or 'Master John the French Leech' ('leech' being an old word for a physician). He first appears in the records in January 1501. He directed the building of alchemical furnaces at <ENT>Stirling<ENT> and Holyroodhouse to produce the quinta essentia, the fifth element. John was then made Abbot of Tongland.  Between 1501 and 1508 he received a great deal of money and other items from the king, to make the quintessence.  These included aqua vitae (i.e. spirits of wine), quicksilver, sal ammoniac, alum, litharge, orpiment, saltpetre, silver, sugar, sulphur, tin, verdigris, vinegar and white lead. These are all standard alchemical substances of the medieval period.
Misawa<SEP>The squadron was again activated in 1987 as the 14th Tactical Fighter Squadron at <ENT>Misawa<ENT> , Japan. It initially trained for close air support using conventional weapons.  It also provided for the air defense of northern Japan.  The squadron has provided personnel and aircraft to support operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Sarum<SEP>The church at Figheldean is first mentioned in Henry I's 1115 charter granting its lands and revenues to the cathedral at <ENT>Sarum<ENT> . A church, possibly a parish church, was recorded at Alton from the mid 12th century until the late 16th.

Oak Ridge atomic plant<SEP>In 1950, while at London, he was personally invited and delegated by American nuclear physicists dr. Alvin M. Weinberg, dr. Robert Charpi, Karl Z. Morgan— the scientists who had worked in Manhattan Project— to the United States where he carried out his research in nuclear power and reactor technology at <ENT>Oak Ridge atomic plant<ENT> whereas he served as a director of Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
Oak Ridge atomic plant<SEP>In 1961, NASA's Space Nuclear Propulsion Office[1], in conjunction with the Atomic Energy Commission, jointly awarded Aerojet General Corporation the prime contract for its Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application NERVA Program, with a significant subcontract to WANL for development of the reactor itself. With the award, WANL selected the Large site as the base for operations and moved its personnel to the facility. Originally authorized in May 1959, WANL officially became a Westinghouse division on July 26, 1959 under the leadership of John Wistar Simpson. Cornell University physicist Sidney Krasik served as the first technical director and Frank Cotter was the first marketing director. Born in 1914, Simpson graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1937 and earned an MS from the University of Pittsburgh in 1941. Working in the switchgear division of Westinghouse's East Pittsburgh plant, Simpson helped develop the electric switchboards that could survive the extreme impacts experienced by naval vessels in the Pacific Theater during World War II. In 1946, he took a leave of absence to work at <ENT>Oak Ridge atomic plant<ENT> to familiarize himself with atomic power. Upon his return, he became assistant manager in the engineering department of the Westinghouse Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory. He subsequently managed the construction of the Shippingport Atomic Power Station in 1954, the first commercial nuclear power plant in the United States. Promoted the next year to general manager of the Bettis Laboratory, he was elected a Westinghouse vice president in 1958 and by 1959 was eager to take on the new challenge of developing nuclear rocket engines to enable the exploration of the solar system.
NYC<SEP>The World's Fair Marina is a public marina in Flushing Bay, Queens, New York. It is located at the northern edge of Flushing Meadows–Corona Park and operated by the Marine Division of the Department of Parks and Recreation. The marina is situated next to a 1.4-mile (2.3 km) long stretch of promenade around Flushing Bay and is also near <ENT>NYC<ENT> and Citi Field.
Salt Lake<SEP>McDonald was born in Holladay, Utah on July 18, 1894, to Francis McDonald and Rozella Stevenson. He attended the first LDS Seminary, the Granite High School Seminary. He served as a missionary in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in the Eastern States Mission, which was headquartered in New York City. He spent part of his mission as president of the Western Pennsylvania Conference headquartered in Pittsburgh.  While serving in this area he met Ella Gibbs, a woman serving as a missionary who was the first Relief Society president in Pittsburgh. Ella was later transferred to Baltimore. After both returned from their missions, McDonald courted Ella Gibbs. They married in <ENT>Salt Lake<ENT> on September 26, 1917. They had two daughters.
Cassino<SEP>Guaimar set out to take possession of his new principality immediately. On 15 August, he conquered Rocca Vandra and gave it to the abbey of <ENT>Cassino<ENT> . Meanwhile, the Normans of Aversa pacified the valley of the Sangro. After Pandulf fled to Constantinople, Guaimar turned his attention to Amalfi. In April 1039, in support of the deposed and blinded Manso II, Guaimar forced the abdication and exile of John II and his mother, Maria, a sister of Pandulf. Guaimar installed himself as duke. Then in July, he conquered Sorrento, which had been conquered by Pandulf in 1034. He gave it to his brother Guy with the title of duke. He also received the homage of the Duke of Naples, John V, who had brought the request for mediation to Constantinople in 1037.
Cassino<SEP>Born in Dubrovnik, then the Republic of Dubrovnik (ital. Ragusa), in 1482, he entered the Benedictine Order in 1507 on the island of Mljet, and after a period of education in <ENT>Cassino<ENT> in Italy returned to Mljet as the abbot of the monastery. In the 16th century, the monastery was the centre of the Mljet Congregation (Congregatio Melitensem or Melitanam), gathering all the monasteries of Benedictine monks in the area of the Republic of Dubrovnik, and Vetranović was the first president of the Congregation.
Luton<SEP>Sir Thomas Hoo the elder distinguished himself by service at the Battle of Agincourt as Knight to Thomas Lord Camoys, commander of the left wing of the English army. At much the same time he became father of the younger Thomas Hoo, half-brother to Lord Hoo, who was born in 1416 and was associated with his brother in life and in posterity. In June 1420 Sir Thomas the father and two others were entrusted to ensure the safe passage of the Duke of Bourbon to France, and in the August following, Sir Thomas died at the ancestral home of <ENT>Luton<ENT> , Bedfordshire.
Twickenham<SEP>Rugby also uses artificial surfaces at a professional level. Infill fields are used by English Aviva Premiership teams Saracens F.C., Newcastle Falcons and Worcester Warriors, as well as Pro14 teams Cardiff Blues and Glasgow Warriors. Some fields, including <ENT>Twickenham<ENT> , have incorporated a hybrid field, with grass and synthetic fibers used on the surface. This allows for the field to be much more hard wearing, making it less susceptible to weather conditions and frequent use.
Auschwitz<SEP>Members of Polgár's family perished in the Holocaust and her grandmother was a survivor of <ENT>Auschwitz<ENT> .
Dachau<SEP>In 1945, Roschmann was arrested in Graz but later released. Roschmann concealed himself as an ordinary prisoner of war, and in so doing obtained a release from custody in 1947. After that however he became imprudent and visited his wife in Graz. He was recognised with the assistance of former concentration camp inmates and arrested by the British military police. Roschmann was sent to <ENT>Dachau<ENT> which had been converted to an imprisonment camp for accused war criminals. Roschmann succeeded in escaping from this custody. In 1948 Roschmann was able to flee Germany. He travelled first to Genoa in Italy, and from there to Argentina by ship, on a pass supplied by the International Red Cross. Roschmann was assisted in this effort by Alois Hudal, a strongly pro-Nazi bishop of the Catholic Church. Roschmann arrived in Argentina either on 10 February 1948 or 2 October 1948 (2/10/1948 or 10/2/1948, depending on date notation used). He founded a wood import-export firm in Buenos Aires.  In 1955 in Argentina Roschmann married, although he was not divorced from his first wife. His second wife left him in 1958; the marriage was later declared null and void. In 1968, under the name "Frederico Wagner" (sometimes seen as "Federico Wegener") he became a citizen of Argentina.
Carnarvon<SEP>In 1911, Williams received a commission from King George V to work on a commemorative painting of the Investiture of Edward, Prince of Wales at <ENT>Carnarvon<ENT> . As well as attending the ceremony, he visited Buckingham Palace, where the Royal Family sat for him in order to complete the detail of the picture. He completed two versions of this painting.
Oak Ridge nuclear facility<SEP>Before being able to complete his studies, Lax was drafted into the U.S. Army. After basic training, the Army sent him to Texas A&M University for more studies. He was then sent to <ENT>Oak Ridge nuclear facility<ENT> , and soon afterwards to the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, New Mexico. At Los Alamos, he began working as a calculator operator, but eventually moved on to higher-level mathematics.
Tabley<SEP>The origins of the Jacob are not known. It has been bred in the British Isles for several hundred years. Sheep of this kind, little different from the modern breed, were shown in paintings from about 1760 at <ENT>Tabley<ENT> in Cheshire, and – by George Stubbs – at Wentworth Woodhouse in Yorkshire.
Ramstein<SEP>21st Operational Weather Squadron’s manning consists of active duty, civilian and contract personnel and is located on Kapaun Air Station, Germany, Under USAFE, <ENT>Ramstein<ENT> , Germany.
San Siro<SEP>Tancredi began his career with Giulianova, and later also played with Milan and Rimini, before joining Roma. He made 288 Serie A appearances for Roma between 1979 and 1990, winning the Scudetto in 1983 and four Coppa Italia titles. In 1987, during a game against Milan at <ENT>San Siro<ENT> , he was hit on the head by a firework thrown by a Milan supporter. He stopped breathing for a short time but was eventually resuscitated by paramedics. He ended his career in 1991 after a season with Torino, where he won the Mitropa Cup but was mainly a back-up to Luca Marchegiani.
Harewood<SEP>Leeds has many large parks and open spaces. Roundhay Park is the largest park in the city, and is one of the largest city parks in Europe. The park has more than 700 acres (2.8 km) of parkland, lakes, woodland and gardens which are all owned by Leeds City Council. Other parks in the city include: Beckett Park, Bramley Fall Park, Cross Flatts Park, East End Park, Golden Acre Park, Gotts Park, the gardens and grounds of <ENT>Harewood<ENT> , Horforth Hall Park, Meanwood Park, Middleton Park, Potternewton Park, Pudsey Park, Temple Newsam, Western Flatts Park and Woodhouse Moor. There are many more smaller parks and open spaces scattered around the city, which makes Leeds one of the greenest cities in the United Kingdom in a 2017 survey. Leeds was ranked at number seven, just behind Sheffield, but ahead of Bradford, Manchester and Liverpool.
San Siro<SEP>In 1997, Zambrotta's Serie A career began when his great potential was spotted by Bari boss Eugenio Fascetti. Zambrotta was snapped up by Fascetti after Bari had won promotion to Serie A. He made his Serie A debut on 31 August 1997 in a 2–0 home defeat to Parma, and in his first year in the top flight, he played on the left wing and scored 2 goals in 27 appearances. In the 1998–99 season, following the departure of Nicola Ventola, Zambrotta exploded on to the scene. In matchday one, he scored the only goal of the match against Venezia after just nine minutes into the first half. Zambrotta continued to shine and was the key figure for Bari's surprise start to the campaign, demonstrating his technical attributes and tactical intelligence and versatility. On matchday seven, he scored the opening goal at <ENT>San Siro<ENT> and helped Bari to win the game 3–2 against Internazionale.
Warwick<SEP>King Ralph was shot in various locations in England. Stand-ins for Buckingham Palace include Wrotham Park, Syon House, Somerset House, Harewood House, Old Royal Naval College, Apsley House, Belvoir Castle, Hagley Hall, Lancaster House, and Blenheim Palace. <ENT>Warwick<ENT> and Hever Castle were used to substitute the interior shots for Windsor Castle. King's Cross St. Pancras tube station was used to film the scene introducing the Finnish Royal Family. Highclere Castle was used for Lord Graves' home. Dalton, South Yorkshire, was the location of Miranda's parents' home.
Vancouver<SEP>Along with his brothers Charles and Lindsay and their families, he joined what became known as the "Great Migration of 1843" on the Oregon Trail. He became one of the leaders of the expedition after it split into two parties over a dispute about whether the large amounts of livestock being driven by some members of the group would slow down their travel. Applegate's party became known as the "cow column" and the other party was called the "light column". After leaving their guide Marcus Whitman at his mission and abandoning their wagons at Fort Walla Walla, the Applegate brothers built boats for traveling down the Columbia River to <ENT>Vancouver<ENT> . Near The Dalles, a boat capsized and Jesse and Lindsay each lost a son to drowning. Lindsay later wrote, "We resolved if we remained in the country, to find a better way for others who might wish to emigrate."
Los Alamos<SEP>Space flight simulators are used almost solely by the aerospace industry and the military for cosmonaut/astronaut training, disaster simulation and spacecraft design. Examples of devices that simulate the environment of outer space include the Large Space Simulator at the European Space Research and Technology Centre and The Space Simulator at <ENT>Los Alamos<ENT> .
Oak Ridge nuclear facility<SEP>The reactor was designed and built by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company based on experimental designs tested by Enrico Fermi at the University of Chicago, and tests from the X-10 Graphite Reactor at <ENT>Oak Ridge nuclear facility<ENT> . It was designed to operate at 250 megawatts (thermal).

Wembley<SEP>Cole lined up for the England squad for the first time since the 2006 World Cup in the 1–1 friendly draw against the Netherlands, on 15 November 2006 providing an assist for Wayne Rooney from a cross. After another injury, he returned to start the friendly against Brazil at <ENT>Wembley<ENT> on 1 June 2007.
Oak Ridge<SEP>Majorana fermions may also emerge as quasiparticles in quantum spin liquids, and were observed by researchers at <ENT>Oak Ridge<ENT> , working in collaboration with Max Planck Institute and University of Cambridge on 4 April 2016.
Warwick<SEP>Whitty's carpets, looking much like horizontal-tapestries, became the benchmark for wealthy aristocrats to have in their country homes and town houses, between 1755 and 1835. The company produced Axminster carpets for: the music room of the Royal Pavilion, Brighton; Chatsworth House; Powderham Castle; Saltram House; and <ENT>Warwick<ENT> . King George III and Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz purchased Axminster carpets and also visited the factory.
Rochester<SEP>In Britain, where the majority of such productions have been staged at churches, cathedrals and abbeys, indoor presentations are frequently preferred, particularly as architectural gems might otherwise not be shown to best advantage.  The first British production was at Greenwich Palace in south London in 1957. In England in particular, where son et lumière is as well received as it is in France, many of the nations's principal historic houses and church buildings have enjoyed such a production.  Of particular interest have been the ones at Canterbury Cathedral (produced as part of the European "Cathedrales en Lumière" events), <ENT>Rochester<ENT> , St Augustine's Abbey, St. George's Hall, Liverpool, Tewkesbury Abbey, St Paul's Cathedral, Hampton Court Palace, and at Chartwell, the country home of Winston Churchill. Part of the London 2012 Olympic bid involved the use of son et lumière inspired light projections of athletes upon various London buildings.
Carnoustie<SEP>Faulkner was joint leader at the halfway stage of the 1937 Daily Mail Tournament but fell back with two rounds 78 on the final day. The following week, in partnership with Stanley Anderson, he won the Addington Foursomes. Faulkner was one of the leading qualifiers for the 1937 Open Championship at <ENT>Carnoustie<ENT> , tying for 6th place. In the championship itself he had a second 83 and missed the cut. He again performed well in the Daily Mirror Assistants' Tournament, despite a poor first day. Final day rounds of 70 and 72 lifted him into 4th place. The following week he finished 3rd in the Irish Open.
Melbourne Airport<SEP>The head of the Maribyrnong catchment is situated in the Macedon Ranges region of central Victoria around 60 kilometres (37 mi) northwest of Melbourne City Centre. Various creeks beginning in the southern Mount Macedon area flow into Riddells Creek which in turn flows into the Jackson Creek. The Jackson Creek starts its journey northwest of Gisborne, 50 kilometres (31 mi) north of Melbourne CBD. The other major tributary of the Maribyrnong is Deep Creek, which also has its headwaters in the northern and eastern parts of the Macedon Ranges. The creek has cut a deep valley through the surrounding basalt plains in its southward course, in particular as it flows through localities such as Konagaderra and Bulla. To the west of <ENT>Melbourne Airport<ENT> the tributaries of the Jackson Creek and the Deep Creek conjoin to form the Maribyrnong River. The Organ Pipes National Park can be found adjacent to the Jackson Creek, near the Calder Freeway, with picnic facilities and a prominent display of basaltic columns a geological formation, so named because they look like organ pipes.
El Escorial<SEP>Around 1517 Raphael painted a great Visitation at the request of Marino Branconio, father of Giovanni Battista. The Visitation enriched the Branconio Chapel inside the church of San Silvestro, near the family palazzo in Aquila. Marino's wife was named Elisabetta, and the Visitation represents the Virgin Mary and Saint Elizabeth. In 1655 the canvas was forcefully removed by occupying Spanish troops and taken to <ENT>El Escorial<ENT> . Today it is part of the permanent collection of the Museo del Prado, while a copy can be seen in the Branconio Chapel.
Rock Island<SEP>Norman Foster Ramsey Jr. was born in Washington, D.C., on August 27, 1915, to Minna Bauer Ramsey, an instructor at the University of Kansas, and Norman Foster Ramsey, a 1905 graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point and an officer in the Ordnance Department who rose to the rank of brigadier general during World War II, commanding <ENT>Rock Island<ENT> . He was raised as an Army brat, frequently moving from post to post, and lived in France for a time when his father was Liaison Officer with the Direction d'Artillerie and Assistant Military Attaché. This allowed him to skip a couple of grades along the way, so that he graduated from Leavenworth High School in Leavenworth, Kansas, at the age of 15.
Epsom<SEP>Gradually improvements were made to the ground. In 1926 a grandstand was acquired from <ENT>Epsom<ENT> , dismantled, moved and rebuilt on the ground to provide much needed seating. This survived until it was finally blown down by gales in March 1968. Slowly each side was converted from grass banking to terracing (this work finally being completed in 1991) and various offices, dressing rooms, coverings for terraces and a clubhouse and function room were added to the site. Floodlights were added in 1967 and a new grandstand was built in 1972 and extended in 1996. A great many of these structures were destroyed in an arson attack in 2000 which gutted the clubhouse, a new 'temporary' clubhouse has been in place since 2000.
Sanford<SEP>Fayetteville Regional Airport was also briefly served by Allegiant Air with nonstop service to <ENT>Sanford<ENT> .
San Siro<SEP>Easter Road is a football stadium located in the Leith area of Edinburgh, Scotland, which is the home ground of Scottish Premiership club Hibernian (Hibs). The stadium currently has an all-seated capacity of 20,421, which makes it the fifth-largest football stadium in Scotland. Easter Road is also known by Hibs fans as "The Holy Ground" or "The <ENT>San Siro<ENT> ". The venue has also been used to stage international matches, Scottish League Cup semi-finals and was briefly the home ground of the Edinburgh professional rugby union team.
South Bank<SEP>In April 2016 Salique's third album No Boundaries was released which launched at Wilton's Music Hall, followed by a concert at <ENT>South Bank<ENT> .
Los Alamos<SEP>Emilio Gino Segrè (1 February 1905 – 22 April 1989) was an Italian-American physicist and Nobel laureate, who discovered the elements technetium and astatine, and the antiproton, a subatomic antiparticle, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1959. From 1943 to 1946 he worked at <ENT>Los Alamos<ENT> as a group leader for the Manhattan Project. He found in April 1944 that Thin Man, the proposed plutonium gun-type nuclear weapon, would not work because of the presence of plutonium-240 impurities.
Dachau<SEP>During World War II he gained an infamous reputation due to his experiments on prisoners at <ENT>Dachau<ENT> . Along with professor Wilhelm Beiglböck [de], he performed tests on 90 Romani prisoners by providing them sea water as their only source of fluids. (In some cases the taste of the water was disguised to hide the saline content.) The prisoners suffered from severe dehydration, and witnesses reported that they had been seen licking the floors they had mopped in an attempt to get some water. The goal of the experiment was to determine if the prisoners would suffer severe physical symptoms or death within a period of 6–12 days.
Elsinore<SEP>Construction of Fort Dansborg started in 1620. Many parts of the fort have been reconstructed several times. Dansborg is the second largest Danish fort ever constructed, with <ENT>Elsinore<ENT> in Helsingør being the largest. The rampart wall is a fairly large four sided structure, with bastions at each cardinal point. A single storied building was constructed along three inner sides of the rampart, with barracks, warehouse, kitchen, and jail. The rooms on the southern side remain in good condition, but the rooms on the western and northern sides have been substantially damaged. On the eastern side of the fort, there was a two storied building facing the sea. It was the main building of the fort. The vaulted lower storey served as a magazine and a warehouse, while the vaulted upper storey contained the church and the lodgings of the governor, the senior merchants, and the chaplain. The sea on the eastern and western side protected the fort. The fort was surrounded by a moat, access to the fort being over a drawbridge. The moat has completely disappeared.
Darlington<SEP>KHI's No. 33 team was formed when Andy Petree Racing's No. 33 Busch team was shut down halfway through the 2004 season. Kevin Harvick purchased the team and it made its debut in the 19th race of the season at Chicagoland Speedway with Clint Bowyer behind the wheel. He started 40th and finished in the 42nd position due to rear end problems. He drove again at <ENT>Darlington<ENT> and finished 15th. Tony Raines ended the season at the Ford 300 with a 35th-place finish after being involved in a crash.
Sarum<SEP>Bowles came from a line of Church of England clergymen. His great-grandfather Matthew Bowles (1652–1742), grandfather Dr Thomas Bowles (1696–1773) and father William Thomas Bowles (1728–1786) had all been parish priests. After taking his degree at Oxford, Bowles followed his forebears into the Church of England, and in 1792, after serving as curate in Donhead St Andrew, was appointed vicar of Chicklade in Wiltshire. In 1797 he received the vicarage of Dumbleton in Gloucestershire, and in 1804 became vicar of Bremhill in Wiltshire, where he wrote the poem seen on Maud Heath's statue. In the same year his bishop, John Douglas, collated him to a prebendal stall in <ENT>Sarum<ENT> . In 1818 he was made chaplain to the Prince Regent, and in 1828 he was elected residentiary canon of Salisbury.
Jax<SEP>The group was first activated as the 1st Emergency Rescue Squadron at Boca Raton Army Air Field, Florida on 1 December 1943 with an initial cadre of one officer and four enlisted men.  The squadron and the 2d Emergency Rescue Squadron, activated two weeks later in California, were the first of their kind in the Army Air Forces.  Two naval officers were attached to the squadron to perform check flights for the pilots, who had received training on the Consolidated PBY-5A Catalina at Naval Air Station Pensacola and <ENT>Jax<ENT> .  The training included water landings on Lake Okeechobee and navigation training.  After two and a half months of training, the unit departed for overseas assignment.  The squadron left for overseas from Camp Patrick Henry, Virginia, sailing on board the SS William L. Mitchell on 3 March.
Oak Ridge<SEP>The Searchinger and Fargione studies gained prominent attention in both the popular media and in scientific journals. The methodology, however, drew some criticism, with Wang and Haq from Argonne National Laboratory posted a public letter and send their criticism about the Searchinger paper to Letters to Science. Another criticism by Kline and Dale from <ENT>Oak Ridge<ENT> was published in Letters to Science. They argued that Searchinger et al. and Fargione et al. "...do not provide adequate support for their claim that biofuels cause high emissions due to land-use change. The U.S. biofuel industry also reacted, claiming in a public letter, that the "Searchinger study is clearly a "worst-case scenario" analysis..." and that this study "relies on a long series of highly subjective assumptions...".
Tredegar<SEP>These weapons were manufactured at <ENT>Tredegar<ENT> (sometimes referred to as J.R. Anderson & Co, after owner Joseph Reid Anderson) in Richmond, Virginia, and at Selma Naval Ordnance Works in Selma, Alabama.
NYC<SEP>The success of NCAR brought renewed attention to Pei's design acumen. He was recruited to work on a variety of projects, including the S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University, the Everson Museum of Art in Syracuse, New York, the Sundrome terminal at <ENT>NYC<ENT> in New York City, and dormitories at New College of Florida.
Middlebury<SEP>Vermont has five colleges within the Vermont State Colleges system, University of Vermont (UVM), and thirteen other private, degree-granting colleges, including Bennington College, Champlain College, Goddard College, Marlboro College, <ENT>Middlebury<ENT> , Saint Michael's College, the Vermont Law School, and Norwich University.
Goldsborough<SEP>The Byerley Turk, the great stallion owned by the then Captain (later Colonel) Robert Byerley, was arguably Middridge's most famous resident. The Byerley Turk was one of the three founding stallions of today's thoroughbred horses and was stood at Middridge Grange, until being moved to <ENT>Goldsborough<ENT> , near Knaresborough, North Yorkshire, when his owner married his cousin, Mary Wharton, in 1692.
Warwick<SEP>Scarborough recovered under King Henry II, who built an Angevin stone castle on the headland and granted the town charters in 1155 and 1163, permitting a market on the sands and establishing rule by burgesses. Edward II granted Scarborough Castle to his favourite, Piers Gaveston. The castle was subsequently besieged by forces led by the barons Percy, Warenne, Clifford and Pembroke. Gaveston was captured and taken to Oxford and thence to <ENT>Warwick<ENT> for execution.
San Siro<SEP>Alan Snoddy (born 29 March 1955) is a retired Northern Irish football referee, known for having refereed two matches in the FIFA World Cup: one in 1986 and one in 1990. At the 1986 World Cup Snoddy was appointed to referee the game between Morocco and Portugal in Guadalajara which ended 3-1 to Morocco. In the 1990 World Cup Snoddy refereed the game between Colombia and West Germany which ended 1-1 at <ENT>San Siro<ENT> in Milan.
Darlington<SEP>HJM debuted in 2000 as Herzog Motorsports with SODA and American Speed Association driver Jimmie Johnson, who had previously worked with them in SODA. Sponsored by wireless company Alltel, Johnson would finish 10th in the points and place third in the  2000 Rookie of the Year points, behind Ron Hornaday and Kevin Harvick. Johnson's rookie year was notable for a crash at Watkins Glen International, where his brakes failed heading into turn 1 and he slammed the barrier head on. He was not injured and even pumped his fists after exiting the car. After Alltel left for Penske Racing, Johnson remained with the team for 2001, sponsored by Excedrin. Johnson gave the team its first ever win at the inaugural race at Chicagoland Speedway. Herzog's plans were to field a Cup team with Johnson, but he had already signed a deal with Hendrick Motorsports for 2002. Herzog then turned to Todd Bodine. Bodine would take the team's second win at Kentucky Speedway and finished 23rd in points. After Excedrin's departure, Herzog Motorsports joined with former baseball player Reggie Jackson to form Herzog–Jackson Motorsports in 2003. With Bodine back at the wheel, the team took its third and final victory at <ENT>Darlington<ENT> . Despite the added presence of fame, the team had sponsors for a few races, but could not attract a major sponsor to pay the bills, despite Bodine leading the points. Troubles were evident when the team skipped the Chicago race and Bodine was released. HJM returned at Kansas with Jeff Green, who finished 11th. That would be the final race for the team, as they shut down near the end of the season.
Brookwood<SEP>He died in Twyford on 14 October 1934. He is buried in <ENT>Brookwood<ENT> in outer London.
Brookwood<SEP>Two weeks before his death in November 1977, Wheatley received conditional absolution from his old friend Cyril 'Bobby' Eastaugh, the Bishop of Peterborough. He was cremated at Tooting and his ashes interred at <ENT>Brookwood<ENT> . He is commemorated on the Baker/Yeats family monument at West Norwood Cemetery.
Carnarvon<SEP>Prince of Wales (Welsh: Tywysog Cymru, Welsh pronunciation: [/təˈwəsog ˈkəmrɨ/]) was a title granted to native Welsh princes before the 12th century; the term replaced the use of the word king. One of the last Welsh princes, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, was killed in battle in 1282 by Edward I, King of England, whose son Edward (born in <ENT>Carnarvon<ENT> in 1284) was invested as the first English Prince of Wales in 1301.
South Bank<SEP>Kinch curated the 2019 Koestler Arts exhibition which showcases artworks created by prisoners and detainees in institutions, and is held at <ENT>South Bank<ENT> in London.
Chantilly<SEP>Landing Light contested four races as a three-year-old in France in 1998, ridden on each occasion by Dominique Boeuf. After finishing second on his racecourse debut at <ENT>Chantilly<ENT> on 3 May he recorded his first victory at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse in June staying on in the closing stage to win by a head from Musgrave over 2000 metres. He finished ninth in the Listed Prix Pelleas at Maisons-Laffitte later in June and did not reappear until October, when he finished seventh in the Listed Prix Vulcan at Saint-Cloud Racecourse
Tabley<SEP>Lord De L'Isle is the only son of William Sidney, 1st Viscount De L'Isle and his wife Jacqueline (née Vereker), a daughter of Field Marshal John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort. He was educated at <ENT>Tabley<ENT> , Mons Officer Cadet School and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. After service in the Rifle Brigade, in 1966, he became a major in the Grenadier Guards and took early retirement in 1979, having spent some of his service in Northern Ireland during The Troubles.
Erebuni<SEP>Besides the Temple of Garni, other sites considered holy by the Arordiners and used for their rituals include the Metsamor Castle (third millennium BCE), considered a site for the cult of the mother goddess, <ENT>Erebuni<ENT> (eighth century BCE), Shengavit (fourth to second millennium BCE) and Zorats Karer (third millennium BCE), and the mountains. Sculptures representing the gods which have been realised within the context of modern Armenian Native Faith are inspired by both historical specimens and the creativity of modern artists.
Springfield<SEP>The economy of rural Massachusetts suffered an economic depression after the war ended. Merchants, pressured for hard currency by overseas partners, made similar demands on local debtors, and the state raised taxes in order to pay off its own war debts. Efforts to collect both public and private debts from cash-poor farmers led to protests that flared into direct action in August 1786. Rebels calling themselves Regulators (after the North Carolina Regulator movement of the 1760s) succeeded in shutting down courts meeting to hear debt and tax collection cases. By the end of 1786 a farmer in western Massachusetts named Daniel Shays emerged as one of the ringleaders, and government attempts to squelch the protests only served to radicalize the protestors. In January 1787 Shays and Luke Day organized an attempt to take the <ENT>Springfield<ENT> ; state militia holding the armory beat back the attempt with cannon fire. A private militia raised by wealthy Boston merchants and led by General Benjamin Lincoln broke the back of the rebellion in early February at Petersham, but small-scale resistance continued in the western parts of the state for a while.
Shinagawa<SEP>The Tōkaidō Shinkansen high-speed rail line began serving <ENT>Shinagawa<ENT> in 2003.
Trafford<SEP>With around 170 stores and services, Liverpool ONE is the largest shopping centre in the city, the second largest in North West England (after <ENT>Trafford<ENT> ) and the fifth largest in the United Kingdom.
Warwick<SEP>Government House's 14.6 hectares (36 acres) property is a publicly accessible area tended by volunteers in the Friends of Government House Gardens Society, and are used frequently by the surrounding community, save for when security otherwise necessitates. The site is divided into numerous different zones according to plant life and/or garden style; for instance, the British Columbia native plant garden contains species unique to the province, and the Cottage Garden is arranged in an informal style with a mixture of ornamental and edible plants. There are also gardens to supply cut flowers, herbs, and an orchard with apple, plum, and quince trees; a rock garden tended by the Heather Society of Victoria; iris, lily, rhododendron, and rose gardens (including a formal Victorian rose garden based on the plan of that at <ENT>Warwick<ENT> in England); and water features such as the fountain pond and the duck pond. There is also a unique 8.9 hectares (22 acres) Garry Oak ecosystem.
Colditz<SEP>The series deals with Allied prisoners of war imprisoned at the supposedly escape- <ENT>Colditz<ENT> when designated Oflag IV-C during World War II, and their many attempts to escape captivity, as well as the relationships formed between the various nationalities and their German captors.
Brookwood<SEP>The monastic Saint Edward Brotherhood was established at <ENT>Brookwood<ENT> in 1982 to prepare and care for a new Church in a fitting grade I landscape in which the relics of Saint Edward the Martyr were soon to be enshrined, the King of England who died in 978 and who was succeeded by force by Ethelred the Unready. It has two communities:
Stirling<SEP>To the principalship was then attached the professorship of divinity, and the salary, which had been four hundred, was increased in 1601 to six hundred marks.In 1617, when James VI and I visited Scotland, a disputation was held before him at <ENT>Stirling<ENT> by the professors of the university, but Charteris declined to take part in it. Among the royal puns on this occasion, James is said to joked on Charteris, 'His name agreeth very well unto nature, for charters contain much matter yet say nothing, but put great purposes in men's mouths.'
Stowe<SEP>In 1733 his relative Nicholas Hammond left Hammond £400 a year, and he became attached to the prince's court as an equerry. Through the prince's influence, as Duke of Cornwall, Hammond was returned to parliament on 13 May 1741 as member for Truro. Hammond then fell into bad health, and died at <ENT>Stowe<ENT> in Buckinghamshire on 7 June 1742, while on a visit to Lord Cobham.
Ampleforth<SEP>Scott was buried by the monks of <ENT>Ampleforth<ENT> outside the west entrance of Liverpool Cathedral, alongside his wife (as a Roman Catholic he could not be buried inside the body of the Cathedral). Although originally planned in the 1942 design for the west end of the Cathedral to be within a porch, the site of the grave was eventually covered by a car park access road. The road layout was changed, the grave was restored and the grave marker replaced in 2012.
El Escorial<SEP>Rizi was first trained by Vincencio Carducho. He became painter to Philip IV in 1656, and held the office under Charles II, who added to it the deputy-keepership of the royal keys. A few years prior, he was appointed painter to the Cathedral of Toledo.  Rizi died at <ENT>El Escorial<ENT> .
Portland<SEP>As a busy shipping lane, the Channel experiences environmental problems following accidents involving ships with toxic cargo and oil spills. Indeed, over 40% of the UK incidents threatening pollution occur in or very near the Channel. One of the  recent occurrences was the MSC Napoli, which  on 18 January 2007 was beached with nearly 1700 tonnes of dangerous cargo in Lyme Bay, a protected World Heritage Site coastline. The ship had been damaged and was en route to <ENT>Portland<ENT> .
Millbank<SEP>Google Maps used to display a dragon in Germany's biggest forest, the 'Pfälzer Wald'. Also a shark in the Netherlands' lake called IJsselmeer, East of Amsterdam was featured. When viewed in Earth Mode or Google Earth, these can be rendered in 3D. There is also a narwhal in the Thames in London, outside <ENT>Millbank<ENT> . The Loch Ness monster also makes an appearance in 'Loch Ness'. A giant red lobster sits atop the Zakim Bridge in Boston, as well as a pink elephant at "Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA".
Lambeth<SEP>Parry was educated at Rugby School and Balliol College, Oxford and began his ordained ministry as a curate in Norham. After time as chaplain to the Bishop of London, Archibald Campbell Tait, he became Rural Dean of Ealing. In 1869 he was appointed Archdeacon of Canterbury and on the Feast of the Annunciation, 25 March 1870, was consecrated at <ENT>Lambeth<ENT> chapel the fourth Bishop of Dover (suffragan bishop in the Diocese of Canterbury), 273 years after the death of the third bishop. A monument to him is in Canterbury Cathedral. In 1882 he was chosen by the Australian bishops to succeed the late Frederic Barker as Bishop of Sydney and Metropolitan of Australia, but he declined the nomination.
Lahore<SEP>The reign of Shah Jahan (1628–1658) represented the height of Mughal architecture, with famous monuments such as the Taj Mahal, Moti Masjid, Red Fort, Jama Masjid and <ENT>Lahore<ENT> being constructed during his reign.
Tortuga<SEP>During the U.S. federal government shutdown of 1995 and 1996, as a protest, the Republic sent a flotilla of Conch Navy civilian and fire department boats to Fort Jefferson, located in <ENT>Tortuga<ENT> , to reopen it. The action was dubbed a "full scale invasion" by the Conch Republic. Inspired by efforts of the Smithsonian Institution to keep its museums open by private donations, local residents had raised private money to keep the park running (a closed park would damage the tourist-dependent local economy), but could find no one to accept the money and reopen the park.
Trim<SEP>In 1367-8 the Bermingham family and their retainers began a private war in County Meath. Burley was appointed to negotiate a  treaty  with them, together with  John Fitzrichard,  High Sheriff of Meath,  and Robert Tyrrel, Baron of Castleknock. A parley was arranged at Carbury but the Berminghams, in breach of the agreed terms, took the commissioners captive. Burley was quickly released in exchange for James Bermingham, then a prisoner in <ENT>Trim<ENT> ; the others were required to pay a ransom. He does not seem to have been ill-treated by his captors.
Bayonne<SEP>An extension of Hudson-Bergen Light Rail from 8th Street to the south would likely continue to Staten Island (with connection to the Staten Island light rail over <ENT>Bayonne<ENT> .  The raising of the bridge does not exclude a future light rail.
Holkham<SEP>In the novel, the Godolphin Arabian was foaled in Morocco and was called Sham. He came to Europe as a diplomatic gift to King Louis XV of France but, due to his poor condition on arrival and relatively small size, was given to the cook as a cart horse. He was soon sold to a woodcarter in Paris, where he was treated poorly and then purchased by the Quaker Edward Coke of <ENT>Holkham<ENT> , older brother of the 1st Earl of Leicester 5th Creation, then sold to Francis, Earl of Godolphin, who maintained a stud in Suffolk, near the racing town of Newmarket.
Stirling<SEP>Eventually Alexander was allowed back to Scotland, and soon on Boxing Day 1548, Hume was taken from the English by a night raid. On 28 December Mariotta sent the news from Edinburgh to Mary of Guise, who had left Holyroodhouse for New Year at <ENT>Stirling<ENT> .  By March 1549, Mariotta was back at Hume with a garrison of French and Spanish troops. Now she wrote to Mary of Guise that the troops were disturbing the villagers because they would not pay for their groceries; Mariotta insisted Guise pay the soldiers so they would not trouble the poor folk of Hume. In another letter she advised Guise to maintain discipline amongst the soldiers at this crucial time for the Auld Alliance;
Ely<SEP>His son Sidney Ladds worked as an architect to <ENT>Ely<ENT> until 1950.
Vatican<SEP>Under the Empire the cool breezes of Praeneste made it a favorite summer resort of wealthy Romans, whose villas studded the neighborhood, though they ridiculed the language and the rough manners of the native inhabitants. The poet Horace ranked "cool Praeneste" with Tibur and Baiae as favored resorts. The emperor Augustus stayed in Praeneste, and Tiberius recovered there from a dangerous illness and made it a municipium. The emperor Marcus Aurelius was at Praeneste with his family when his 7-year-old son Verus died.  The ruins of the imperial villa associated with Hadrian stand in the plain near the church of S. Maria della Villa, about three-quarters of a mile from the town. At the site was discovered the Braschi Antinous, now in <ENT>Vatican<ENT> . Pliny the Younger also had a villa at Praeneste, and L. Aurelius Avianius Symmachus retired there. Inscriptions show that the inhabitants of Praeneste were fond of gladiatorial shows.
NYC<SEP>Delta Air Lines is the carrier with the largest market share out of SRQ, with flights to Atlanta, New York <ENT>NYC<ENT> , Detroit, and Boston. The airport has two fixed-base operators: Rectrix Aviation and Dolphin Aviation.
Sarum<SEP>Between Bath and Shepton Mallet the line of the Fosse Way follows parts of the A367, through Clandown, Radstock, Westfield and Stratton-on-the-Fosse. It runs across open country and farm tracks parallel to the A37 north of Shepton Mallet, near the Iron Age hill fort of Maesbury. At Beacon Hill south of Oakhill, it crossed the Roman road along the Mendip ridgeway from <ENT>Sarum<ENT> to the lead and silver mines at Charterhouse. The Fosse Way passes through the eastern suburbs of Shepton Mallet on a short stretch of the A361 to Cannard's Grave, where it picks up the A37.
South Bank<SEP>The NSRO played in Malvern in July 2008 (although with only a two-person line-up) and returned in full strength to the Green Man Festival in August.  On 27 September 2008 the NSRO performed an "open rehearsal" at the Purcell Room, <ENT>South Bank<ENT> , London in a double bill with Ted Barnes. This was part of the Open Weekend event (itself part of the 2008 Cultural Oympiad).
Dunvegan<SEP>On 16 June, Lord Loudoun having received information about the Young Pretender ordered six independent companies to Skye, these were the three MacLeod and three MacDonald companies who were under the command of MacLeod of Talisker. Three of the companies were to be transported to South Uist. On 21 June MacLeod of Talisker crossed over to Skye and marched to Loch Bracadale where Bernera's, Aird's and Kirkibost's companies were to embark for South Uist. However, they were prevented from doing so by bad storms. On 29 June the storms having stopped the three companies sailed to South Uist, arriving the next day. On 30 June William Tolmie at <ENT>Dunvegan<ENT> wrote to the Laird of MacLeod that the latest information was that "the Young Gentleman went from South Uist upon Tuesday (24 June) for the mainland in an eight oared boat and upon Wednesday was endeavouring in to Ruindunan. But a crowed of people from the land frightened them from landing in there place, so went off but God knows where".
Salt Lake<SEP>Young was released as president of the Sevier Stake in 1933 when he was called to served as president of the Manti Temple. He served in this position until 1943. Young served as president of <ENT>Salt Lake<ENT> from 1949 to 1953.
Norfolk<SEP>In 1993, the city was further impacted economically by the end of the Cold War when a decision of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) directed that Naval Base Charleston be closed and that its surface ships and nuclear-powered submarines be relocated to other homeports, primarily <ENT>Norfolk<ENT> , Virginia and Naval Station Mayport, Florida.  Pursuant to BRAC action, Naval Base Charleston was closed on April 1, 1996, although some activities remain under the cognizance of Naval Support Activity Charleston, now part of Joint Base Charleston.
Winchester<SEP>John Harewell raised money for the completion of the west front by William Wynford, who was appointed as master mason in 1365. One of the foremost architects of his time, Wynford worked for the king at Windsor, <ENT>Winchester<ENT> and New College, Oxford. At Wells, he designed the western towers of which north-west was not built until the following century. In the 14th century, the central piers of the crossing were found to be sinking under the weight of the crossing tower which had been damaged by an earthquake in the previous century. Strainer arches, sometimes described as scissor arches, were inserted by master mason William Joy to brace and stabilise the piers as a unit.
Dockery<SEP>The album's first song, Jesus Is A Dying Bedmaker was recorded inside the cotton gin at <ENT>Dockery<ENT> , Patton's childhood home.
Uppsala<SEP>In 2012, a poll by <ENT>Uppsala<ENT> found that Swedes responded that face-covering Islamic veils are either completely unacceptable or fairly unacceptable, 85% for the burqa and 81% for the niqab. The researchers noted these figures represented a compact resistance to the face-covering veil by the population of Sweden.
Carnarvon<SEP>In 1923 the castle became Britain's first private hospital for the investigation and treatment of obscure internal diseases but this was closed in about 1950. Since the 1960s the castle remains have been incorporated into a hotel. A notable guest was Prince Charles, who stayed here for the night before his investiture as Prince of Wales at <ENT>Carnarvon<ENT> in 1969.
South Bank<SEP>The Touring Exhibitions Group was set up following the closure by the Victoria & Albert Museum of its Circulation Department, which had been one of the two main sources of exhibitions for regional museums and galleries in the U.K. It was never intended to replace what was lost, by organising itself a new range of exhibitions. Instead, it provided a voice for regional venues (and their visitors) which had been deprived of material of high quality. Its aim was two-fold: first, to lobby H.M. Government to replace the funding whose withdrawal had led to the closure, and second, to represent venues’ needs to potential alternative sources of exhibitions. The campaign began with a serious handicap, in that the collections of the Circulation Department, hitherto dedicated to “regional” use, had been integrated into the other departments in the Museum. Its first success was persuading H.M Government to fund the establishment in 1988 of a travelling exhibitions unit at the Museums & Galleries Commission (MGC), a previous incarnation of the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council. In the event, this unit lasted less than five years because the politicians were disappointed that significant quantities of so-called ‘hidden treasures’ – not least those which the specialist departments at the V&A had recently absorbed from the Circulation Department - were not being released from the basements of the national museums and galleries. TEG's campaigning role continues notwithstanding, and it contributes when it can to consultations undertaken by Arts Council England, the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, Heritage Lottery Fund, etc., to ensure that touring is included in wider policy discussions and to argue for more resources and better funding for touring exhibitions. In the other direction, organisations such as the Crafts Council, Creative Scotland and <ENT>South Bank<ENT> have observer status on the Executive Committee, which provides them with a forum where they can contribute to discussions on current issues and concerns and where they can exert influence rather than act directly.
Watertown<SEP>From 1879 to 1884 Crozier was instructor in mathematics at West Point, and was superintendent of <ENT>Watertown<ENT> from 1884 to 1887. In 1888 he was sent by the War Department to study recent developments in artillery in Europe, and on return he was placed in full charge of the construction of gun carriages for the army. With General Adelbert R. Buffington, a future chief of ordnance, he invented the Buffington–Crozier disappearing gun carriage (1893). He also invented a wire-wound gun, and perfected many appliances connected with heavy and field ordnance.
Winchester<SEP>In 971, John XIII published a bull supporting the action of the English king Edgar and Archbishop Dunstan against the canons of <ENT>Winchester<ENT> , who refused to give up their wives and concubines. In that same year, John confirmed the privileges which King Edgar had granted the monks of Glastonbury Abbey, and declared that it was under papal protection. Further, John sent a letter to an Ealdorman named Aelfric, commanding him to cease taking money from Glastonbury.
South Bank<SEP>Performed by Lisa Dwan, firstly in London's Battersea Arts Centre in 2005. Dwan was interviewed with Billie Whitelaw as part of the Beckett celebrations on BBC Radio 3. Dwan performed the piece again in July 2009 in <ENT>South Bank<ENT> in London in a time of nine minutes and fifty seconds; it usually plays for anything between twelve and fifteen minutes. The performance has since toured around the world, garnering five star reviews.
Oak Ridge atomic plant<SEP>The Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF), formerly the National Leadership Computing Facility, is a designated user facility operated by <ENT>Oak Ridge atomic plant<ENT> and the Department of Energy.  It contains several supercomputers, the largest of which is an IBM  OLCF-4 named Summit, which was ranked 1st on the TOP500 list of world's fastest supercomputers as of June 2018. It is located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.
Pembroke<SEP>He served as Sheriff of Hampshire (1228–1232), Sheriff of Devon (1234), and Sheriff of Yorkshire (1239–1242); also as  Constable of Winchester Castle, <ENT>Pembroke<ENT> , Haverfordwest Castle, Cilgerran Castle, Tenby Castle, Rochester Castle (1247), Canterbury Castle (1247) and Corfe Castle. He was also Governor of the Channel Islands.
Glastonbury<SEP>After suffering declining health for years, Bradley died at Alta Bates Medical Center in Berkeley on September 25, 1999, four days after suffering a debilitating heart attack. Her ashes were later scattered at <ENT>Glastonbury<ENT> in Somerset, England.
Oak Ridge nuclear facility<SEP>Cryopreservation was applied to humans beginning in 1954 with three pregnancies resulting from the insemination of previously frozen sperm. Fowl sperm was cryopreserved in 1957 by a team of scientists in the UK directed by Christopher Polge.  During 1963, Peter Mazur, at <ENT>Oak Ridge nuclear facility<ENT> in the U.S., demonstrated that lethal intracellular freezing could be avoided if cooling was slow enough to permit sufficient water to leave the cell during progressive freezing of the extracellular fluid. That rate differs between cells of differing size and water permeability: a typical cooling rate around 1 °C/minute is appropriate for many mammalian cells after treatment with cryoprotectants such as glycerol or dimethyl sulphoxide, but the rate is not a universal optimum.
Shinagawa<SEP>On April 8, 2004, Uekusa was arrested for trying to peep under a high school girl's skirt using his hand mirror on an escalator at <ENT>Shinagawa<ENT> of East Japan Railway Company in Minato, Tokyo. Immediately after the arrest, Uekusa admitted his guilt, and he apologized. He was dismissed from being a professor on May 7, 2004 because of the arrest, despite denying the charges.
Charing Cross<SEP>Between 6 and 7 pm, the police opened the southern exits of the Square and slowly moved people out of Trafalgar Square. A large section of the crowd was moved back down Northumberland Avenue and allowed over the River Thames in order to return to their organised transport. Two other sections of demonstrators, now very angry and aggravated, were pushed north into the wealthy shopping streets of West End, which suffered reported theft and vandalism. Published accounts detail shop windows being broken, goods looted, and cars being overturned in Piccadilly Circus, Oxford Street, Regent Street, <ENT>Charing Cross<ENT> , and Covent Garden. Police ordered pubs to close.
Oak Ridge<SEP>In January 1993, Plummer moved to a joint position at The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and <ENT>Oak Ridge<ENT> . His research interests have shifted to the study on an atomic scale of phase transitions in reduced dimensionality and surfaces of highly correlated electron systems such as transition-metal oxides. His primary research tool has been variable-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy.  In 2000, Plummer became the Director of the Tennessee Advanced Materials Laboratory, a state-funded Center of Excellence.
Uppsala<SEP>He has received honorary doctorates from the University of Chicago (1967), the University of Vienna (1971) the City University of New York (1972). On 2 June 1995 he received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Social Sciences at <ENT>Uppsala<ENT> , Sweden. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 2006.
Oak Ridge nuclear facility<SEP>Chase left Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 1953 and worked with Gus Doermann at <ENT>Oak Ridge nuclear facility<ENT> in Tennessee, and later at the University of Rochester. Throughout the 1950s, she returned yearly to Cold Spring Harbor to take part in meetings of the Phage Group of biologists. In 1959, she began doctoral studies at University of Southern California in the laboratory of Giuseppe Bertani. Bertani moved to Sweden and Chase finished her thesis with Margaret Lieb in 1964.
Cardiff City<SEP>On 1 April 2009, Williams scored an own goal in a 2–0 loss to Germany in qualification for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, deflecting Mario Gómez's cross at the Millennium Stadium. He captained the country for the first time on 14 November in a 3–0 friendly win over Scotland at <ENT>Cardiff City<ENT> . On 11 October 2010, he scored his first international goal in a 5–1 friendly win over Luxembourg in Parc y Scarlets, finishing a header from debutant Steve Morison.
El Escorial<SEP>In disgust, Vendôme retired to his estates. It wasn't long, however, before he was summoned back to take command of the army of his cousin, Philip V of Spain. There he won his last victories, crowning his work triumphantly in the battles of Brihuega and Villaviciosa. Before the end of the war, he died suddenly at Vinaròs on 11 June 1712 and was buried in <ENT>El Escorial<ENT> in Spain.
Oak Ridge<SEP>The crossed molecular beam technique was developed by Dudley Herschbach and Yuan T. Lee, for which they were awarded the 1986 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.  While the technique was demonstrated in 1953 by Taylor and Datz of <ENT>Oak Ridge<ENT> , Herschbach and Lee refined the apparatus and began probing gas-phase reactions in unprecedented detail.
Habbaniya<SEP>In May 1941, the Divisional Headquarters and elements of the division (notably the 4th Cavalry Brigade), together with a battalion of infantry from the Essex Regiment (the 1st Battalion), a mechanised regiment from the Arab Legion and supporting artillery was reorganised as Habforce for operations in Iraq including the relief of the base at <ENT>Habbaniya<ENT> and the occupation of Baghdad. Following this, in July 1941, Habforce was placed under the command of Australian I Corps and was involved in operations against the Vichy French in Syria, advancing from eastern Iraq near the Trans-Jordan border to capture Palmyra and secure the Haditha - Tripoli oil pipeline.
Oak Ridge<SEP>Chase left Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 1953 and worked with Gus Doermann at <ENT>Oak Ridge<ENT> in Tennessee, and later at the University of Rochester. Throughout the 1950s, she returned yearly to Cold Spring Harbor to take part in meetings of the Phage Group of biologists. In 1959, she began doctoral studies at University of Southern California in the laboratory of Giuseppe Bertani. Bertani moved to Sweden and Chase finished her thesis with Margaret Lieb in 1964.
Souda<SEP>In 1963–1964, now under command of Captain Frederick H. Michaelis, Enterprise made her second and third deployments to the Mediterranean. During her third deployment, the carrier was part of Operation Sea Orbit, the world's first nuclear-powered task force with the cruisers Long Beach and Bainbridge, together forming a convoy to sail around the world. On 25 February 1964, a crewman of the Finnish merchant ship Verna Paulin was injured in a fall while the ship was in the vicinity of <ENT>Souda<ENT> , Greece. Enterprise answered her call for assistance. A surgeon was transferred to Verna Paulin by helicopter. In October 1964, Enterprise returned to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company for her first Refueling and Overhaul.
Southampton<SEP>In 1991, Massachusetts Institute of Technology undergraduate Ellen Spertus wrote an essay "Why Are There So Few Women in Computer Science?", which complained about inherent sexism in IT, which was responsible for a lack of women in computing. She subsequently taught computer science at Mills College, Oakland in order to increase interest in IT for women. A key problem is a lack of female role models in the IT industry, alongside computer programmers in fiction and the media generally being male. <ENT>Southampton<ENT> 's Wendy Hall has said the attractiveness of computers to women decreased significantly in the 1980s when they "were sold as toys for boys", and believes the cultural stigma has remained ever since, and may even be getting worse. Kathleen Lehman, project manager of the BRAID Initiative at UCLA has said a problem is that typically women aim for perfection and feel disillusioned when code does not compile, whereas men may simply treat it as a learning experience. A report in the Daily Telegraph suggested that women generally prefer people-facing jobs, which many computing and IT positions do not have, while men prefer jobs geared towards objects and tasks.
Trafford<SEP>An opportunity for expansion came in 1998 with the opening of <ENT>Trafford<ENT> . Green Triangle introduced two new daytime services to the centre in the form of the 673 from Atherton and the 674 from Leigh. The 673 only lasted a short time, although the link was later reinstated as the 132; the 674 continues to this day, although it is now numbered 126.
Salt Lake<SEP>In the years prior to his presidency, Kimball kept a binder of notes and clippings related to the issue. In the first years of his presidency, he was recorded as frequently making the issue one of investigation and prayer. In June 1977, Kimball asked at least three general authorities, apostles Bruce R. McConkie, Thomas S. Monson, and Boyd K. Packer, to submit memos "on the doctrinal basis of the prohibition and how a change might affect the Church." McConkie wrote a long treatise concluding there were no scriptural impediments to a change. In 1977, Kimball obtained a personal key to <ENT>Salt Lake<ENT> for entering in the evenings after the temple closed and often spent hours alone in its upper rooms praying for divine guidance on a possible change. On May 30, 1978, Kimball presented his two counselors with a statement that he had written in longhand that removed all racial restrictions on ordination to the priesthood, stating that he "had a good, warm feeling about it."
Oak Ridge<SEP>The first large-scale nuclear reactors were built during World War II. These reactors were designed for the production of plutonium for use in nuclear weapons. The only reprocessing required, therefore, was the extraction of the plutonium (free of fission-product contamination) from the spent natural uranium fuel. In 1943, several methods were proposed for separating the relatively small quantity of plutonium from the uranium and fission products. The first method selected, a precipitation process called the bismuth phosphate process, was developed and tested at <ENT>Oak Ridge<ENT> (ORNL) between 1943 and 1945 to produce quantities of plutonium for evaluation and use in the US weapons programs. ORNL produced the first macroscopic quantities (grams) of separated plutonium with these processes.
Oak Ridge nuclear facility<SEP>Born in Basel, he has a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Basel on the thesis Analyse graphischer Integrationsmethoden advised by Alexander Ostrowski and Andreas Speiser (1953). Since then, he did postdoctoral work as a Janggen-Pöhn Research Fellow at the Istituto Nazionale per le Applicazioni del Calcolo in Rome (1954) and at the Harvard Computation Laboratory (1955). He had positions at the National Bureau of Standards (1956–59),  the American University in Washington D.C., <ENT>Oak Ridge nuclear facility<ENT> (1959–63) before joining Purdue University where he has worked from 1963 to 2000 and now being professor emeritus.

Norton<SEP>On 28 March 1951, the California Air National Guard 106th Bombardment Group was activated to federal service at March and put on active duty. The group was initially equipped with refurbished B-29s and its mission was to train reservists to backfill rotating B-29 combat crews serving in Korea. While the reservists were undergoing training they were paid on the lesser reserve pay scale. The group was redesignated as the 320th Bombardment Wing replacing the 106th in December 1952. At March, the wing conducted global bombardment training and air refueling operations to meet SAC commitments. Trained B-47 cadre for 96th Bombardment Wing, Medium, December 1953 – January 1955. Deployed as a wing to <ENT>Norton<ENT> , England, 5 June – 4 September 1954, and Andersen AFB, Guam, 5 October 1956 – 11 January 1957. The 320th was inactivated on 15 December 1960. Also during the Korean War, the Air Force Reserve 330th Bombardment Group, was ordered to active duty on 1 May 1951 at March. The 330th flew borrowed B-29s from the 106th Bomb Group to train the reservists on the aircraft. The group was inactivated on 16 June and its personnel were sent to bases in Japan and Okinawa as replacements for active-duty personnel with B-29 groups.
Ohio<SEP>Walter Sylvester Gamertsfelder, Ph.D., LL.D. (1885 – 1967) was a professor of philosophy, dean and thirteenth president of <ENT>Ohio<ENT> , serving during the final years of World War II from 1943 to 1945.
Solovetsky<SEP>The settlement of Pechenga was founded as the Pechenga Monastery in 1533 at the influx of the Pechenga River into the Barents Sea, 135 kilometers (84 mi) west of modern Murmansk, by St. Tryphon, a monk from Novgorod. Inspired by the model of <ENT>Solovetsky<ENT> , Tryphon wished to convert the local Skolt Sami population to Christianity and to demonstrate how faith could flourish in the most inhospitable lands.
Wells<SEP>Sophia Jex-Blake was born at 3 Croft Place Hastings, England on 21 January 1840, daughter of retired lawyer Thomas Jex-Blake, a proctor of Doctors' Commons, and Mary Jex-Blake née Cubitt. Her brother was Thomas Jex-Blake, future Dean of <ENT>Wells<ENT> , and father of Katharine Jex-Blake, classicist and Mistress of Girton College, Cambridge. Until the age of eight she was home-educated. She attended various private schools in southern England and in 1858 enrolled at Queen's College, London, despite her parents' objections. In 1859, while still a student, she was offered a post as mathematics tutor at the college where she stayed until 1861, living for some of that time with Octavia Hill's family. She worked without pay: her family did not expect their daughter to earn a living, and indeed her father refused her permission to accept a salary.

Twickenham<SEP>The stadium has also been favourably compared to Cardiff's Millennium Stadium and London's <ENT>Twickenham<ENT> .
Rock Island<SEP>The Renaissance Revival-style building was designed by L.G. Hallberg of Chicago and E.S. Hammatt of Davenport. A large central pediment with four two-story pilasters dominate in main façade of the building over the main entrance. Smaller pediments flank the ends of the façade and help to give the structure a balanced appearance. The exterior walls feature heavy textured stone on the ground level and smooth masonry walls on the second and third levels of the building. The buff-colored dolomite limestone was quarried near LeClaire, Iowa. It is the same quarry that produced the stone blocks that were used to build the shops on nearby <ENT>Rock Island<ENT> . The dome on top of the building is based on 16th-century Italian designs.
Carnarvon<SEP>The first major link between Welsh Gold and the Royal family began on 13 July 1911 when Prince Edward, later King Edward VIII, was officially invested as Prince of Wales in a special ceremony at <ENT>Carnarvon<ENT> on the fringes of Snowdonia, North Wales.
Salisbury<SEP>There have been some recent revivals both in the English-speaking world and on the continent. Most famous perhaps is that of Hereford, revived in 1973 for a special children's service, with full and traditional ceremonies following annually since 1982.  The Boy Bishop preaches a sermon and leads prayers at various Diocesan Advent services. A single revival took place in 1959 at St. George's Parish Church, Stockport. Such ceremonies are now also found at Westminster Cathedral, <ENT>Salisbury<ENT> , and a number of parish churches throughout England, including All Saints' Church, Northampton, Claines, Worcestershire, and also St Christopher's Parish Church, Bournemouth, (early 1950s), where the Boy Bishop was installed on St Christopher's Day, (July 25), and 'reigned' for one year, preaching and 'presiding' at youth events. The market town of Alcester, Warwickshire has its very own St Nicholas night complete with the Boy Bishop on 6 December each year.
Glastonbury<SEP>The church was originally dedicated to Gildas.  The first recorded Rector was John de Hancle in 1304. The patronage of the church was held by <ENT>Glastonbury<ENT> until the dissolution of the monasteries when it passed to the Marquess of Bath.

Oak Ridge atomic plant<SEP>After a start-up phase, ICON completed its first project in August 2005 with the web publication of a database on nanotechnology environmental, health and safety research (EHS). Initially compiled by a team at <ENT>Oak Ridge atomic plant<ENT> for the Chemical Industry Consultative Board on Advancing Nanotechnology, the database was turned over to ICON in spring 2005 to maintain and make web accessible. Further refinements have been made to the database over the years, including weekly updates, better indexing and search functionalities, and a Virtual Journal of Nanotechnology Environment, Health and Safety interface. The Virtual Journal and database are now widely used by people around the world to find abstracts, citations and links to published research papers on nanotechnology EHS.
San Siro<SEP>In 1981, Cavese was able to gain its first (and only) promotion to Serie B. The first Serie B season for Cavese ended in a 15th place which allowed the team to avoid relegation. The 1982–83 Serie B season was the top season ever for the Campanian team in its whole history: in fact, Cavese was almost to reach promotion to Serie A, ending the first half of the season in a third placed, which would allow the promotion, and sixth at the end of the season. That championship is remembered especially for the crushing 2–1 victory in <ENT>San Siro<ENT> against A.C. Milan. The scorers were Joe Jordan for Milan, and Tivelli and Di Michele for Cavese. However, the next season Cavese relegated to Serie C1, and was not able to reach Serie B anymore. The team was even cancelled from Italian football in 1991, and readmitted in the Eccellenza Campania with the denomination S.S. Cavese 1919.

Akrotiri<SEP>1970 to 1974 was spent in Britain as part of the Allied Command Europe Mobile Force, with the battalion undertaking two four-month tours of duty in Northern Ireland. The battalion was then posted to Cyprus in early 1974. Unfortunately, Turkey invaded the island and created the "Green Line", which still partitions the island. During the action of moving service families and holidaymakers to safety from Limassol, Piper Malcolm Halliday played at the roadside becoming known as "The piper of Cyprus". This had put the Regiment on a war footing and they were involved in riots attacking <ENT>Akrotiri<ENT> and protection of the Sovereign Area Base of Episkopi. They were relieved in early 1975 returning unexpectedly to Kirknewton near Edinburgh and did a further four-month tour of Northern Ireland, where three soldiers were lost in a roadside bomb attack. They moved to Münster in mid-1976 as the Nuclear Convoy Battalion charged with the protection of 8 Regiment RCT. In this role, the Battalion was equipped with Landrovers, a change from the normal equipment used by previous and subsequent NCB units, which were armoured infantry battalions. Returning to Scotland in 1979, C Company was detached as 'C Battalion' providing administrative support to the Edinburgh Tattoo. In 1980, they undertook a two-month tour in Northern Ireland, and moved there under 39th Infantry Brigade in 1981 for a two-year deployment. In 1983, they returned to Kirknewton for two years and during this time they were deployed to the Falkland Islands for four months. In 1985, they returned to Germany, deploying to the Persian Gulf in 1990 for Operation Desert Storm.
Dachau<SEP>Stanisław Grzesiuk was born May 6, 1918 in Małków near Chełm. Early in his life his family moved to Warsaw's borough of Czerniaków, a distinct cultural area populated mostly by factory workers and other working poor. After graduating from a local trade school he started work as an electro-technician for various enterprises. After the outbreak of World War II he was arrested by the Germans in 1940 and sent to Germany as a slave worker. However, on April 4 of that year he was sent to <ENT>Dachau<ENT> following an attempted escape. He was later transferred to Gusen I (Mauthausen) and would spend almost five years there until the camp's liberation by the American army.
Winchester<SEP>Notwithstanding her Yorkist family background and her husband's desertion of the Tudor cause in support of King Richard, she and Thomas (since returned to England) were both guests at King Henry VII's's coronation. The following month, the new king lifted the attainder which had been placed on Thomas in January 1484 by Richard III for his participation in the Duke of Buckingham's unsuccessful rebellion. The Dorsets also attended the wedding of Henry and Elizabeth of York in January 1486. Elizabeth was Thomas's eldest uterine half-sister by his mother's second marriage to King Edward. When she was crowned Queen consort in November 1487, Cecily and Thomas were present inside Westminster Abbey to witness the ceremony. Cecily had been honoured the preceding year on the occasion of Prince Arthur's baptism, when she was chosen to carry the boy's train while her mother-in-law, the dowager queen, stood as the Prince's sponsor. The ceremony had taken place at <ENT>Winchester<ENT> .
Southampton<SEP>Born in Stratford-upon-Avon, United Kingdom, he attended Repton public school alongside Jeremy Clarkson. Newey was asked to leave Repton at the age of 16 after an incident at a Greenslade concert at Repton's 11th-century Pears Building organised by the school's sixth formers, where he pushed up the sound levels on the band's mixer, blowing out the building's stained glass windows. Newey gained a first class honours degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics from <ENT>Southampton<ENT> in 1980. Immediately after graduation he began working in motor sport for the Fittipaldi Formula One team under Harvey Postlethwaite. In 1981, he joined the March team. After a period as race engineer for Johnny Cecotto in European Formula 2 Newey began designing racing cars. His first project, the March GTP sports car, was a highly successful design and won the IMSA GTP title two years running.
Stirling<SEP>Bastian Pagez was a French servant and musician at the court of Mary, Queen of Scots. He devised part of the entertainment at the baptism of Prince James at <ENT>Stirling<ENT> in 1566. When Mary was exiled in England, Bastian and his family continued in her service. The 19th-century historian Agnes Strickland considered his court role as equivalent to the English Master of the Revels; in England he was Mary's chamber valet and designed her embroidery patterns.
Deptford<SEP>Launched on 21 September 1785, Romulus was taken down the Thames to <ENT>Deptford<ENT> . Work began on 11 October to have her sheathed in copper and rigged for sailing to Portsmouth.

Haditha<SEP>The Hindiya Barrage on the Iraqi Euphrates, based on plans by British civil engineer William Willcocks and finished in 1913, was the first modern water diversion structure built in the Tigris–Euphrates river system. The Hindiya Barrage was followed in the 1950s by the Ramadi Barrage and the nearby Abu Dibbis Regulator, which serve to regulate the flow regime of the Euphrates and to discharge excess flood water into the depression that is now Lake Habbaniyah. Iraq's largest dam on the Euphrates is <ENT>Haditha<ENT> ; a 9-kilometre-long (5.6 mi) earth-fill dam creating Lake Qadisiyah. Syria and Turkey built their first dams in the Euphrates in the 1970s. The Tabqa Dam in Syria was completed in 1973 while Turkey finished the Keban Dam, a prelude to the immense Southeastern Anatolia Project, in 1974. Since then, Syria has built two more dams in the Euphrates, the Baath Dam and the Tishrin Dam, and plans to build a fourth dam – the Halabiye Dam – between Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor. The Tabqa Dam is Syria's largest dam and its reservoir (Lake Assad) is an important source of irrigation and drinking water. It was planned that 640,000 hectares (2,500 sq mi) should be irrigated from Lake Assad, but in 2000 only 100,000–124,000 hectares (390–480 sq mi) had been realized. Syria also built three smaller dams on the Khabur and its tributaries.

He followed this up with goals in Napoli's next two fixtures: wins over Atalanta at home and Milan at <ENT>San Siro<ENT> .
Stone Mountain<SEP>The tree was first discovered in 1849 at <ENT>Stone Mountain<ENT> , Georgia, where several stands of pure specimens grow along the popular walk-up trail at around 1,300 feet (near the large chestnut oak in the middle of the trail and before the rest pavilion halfway up the trail). Georgia oaks are also found at nearby monadnocks, including Panola Mountain and Arabia Mountain in Georgia.
Chantilly<SEP>Despite his defeat at the Curragh, the colt was again stepped up in class for the Group One Prix du Jockey Club at <ENT>Chantilly<ENT> on 5 June. After restraining the colt in the early stages Fallon attempted to make a forward move in the straight but Scorpion made no progress and finished sixteenth of the seventeen runners behind Shamardal, who defeated the favourite Hurricane Run by a neck. Scorpion was moved up in distance three weeks later and started a 25/1 outsider for the Irish Derby over one and a half miles at the Curragh. Ridden by Colm O'Donoghue he took the lead in the straight and kept on well after being overtaken by Hurricane Run to finish second, half a length behind the winner. Scorpion returned to France for the Grand Prix de Paris over 2400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 14 July. Reunited with Fallon, he started the 6/4 favourite against eight opponent headed by the Prix du Lys winner Desideratum. After racing just behind the leaders he took the lead in the straight and drew away in the last 200 metres to win by two and a half lengths from Desideratum.
Lorsch<SEP>In 1068, Emperor Henry IV attempted to divorce Bertha of Savoy. The Papal legate Peter Damian hinted that any further insistence towards divorce would lead the Pope to deny his coronation. Henry obeyed and his wife, who had retired to <ENT>Lorsch<ENT> returned to Court.
Abu Ghraib<SEP>The 1st Marine Division had established a base at one of Saddam Hussein's palaces about one mile north of Hillah. The 372nd Military Police Company had performed law and order and Iraqi Police training in the city from June 2003 to October 2003 prior to moving on to <ENT>Abu Ghraib<ENT> . The city was part of the Polish military zone under the occupation of Iraq.
Cosford<SEP>No. 49 Squadron was assigned to Air Vice Marshal Wilfrid Oulton's Operation Grapple Task Force to conduct nuclear tests at Christmas Island in the Pacific Ocean as part of the British hydrogen bomb programme. No 49 Squadron had eight Valiants, but only four deployed: XD818, piloted by Hubbard, now a Wing Commander; XD822, piloted by Squadron Leader L. D. (Dave) Roberts; XD823, piloted by Squadron Leader Arthur Steele; and XD824, piloted by Squadron Leader Barney Millett. The other four Valiants remained at RAF Wittering, where they were used as courier aircraft for bomb components. The first mission was flown by Hubbard in XD818, with Millett and XD824 as the "grandstand" observation aircraft.  The bomb was dropped from 45,000 feet (14,000 m) off the shore of Malden Island  at 10:38 local time on 15 May 1957. Hubbard missed the target by just 418 yards (382 m). He became the first British pilot to drop a live hydrogen bomb. The bomb was a failure; its yield was estimated at 300 kilotonnes of TNT (1,300 TJ), far below its designed capability. Hubbard and his four crew members were awarded the Air Force Cross in the 1957 Birthday Honours. His aircraft, Vickers Valiant XD818 is now on display in the Royal Air Force Museum at <ENT>Cosford<ENT> .
Oak Ridge atomic plant<SEP>The High Flux Isotope Reactor (or HFIR) is a  nuclear research reactor located at <ENT>Oak Ridge atomic plant<ENT> (ORNL) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, United States.  Operating at 85 MW, HFIR is one of the highest flux reactor-based sources of neutrons for condensed matter physics research in the United States, and it provides one of the highest steady-state neutron fluxes of any research reactor in the world. The thermal and cold neutrons produced by HFIR are used to study physics, chemistry, materials science, engineering, and biology. The intense neutron flux, constant power density, and constant-length fuel cycles are used by more than 500 researchers each year for neutron scattering research into the fundamental properties of condensed matter.  HFIR has approximately 600 users each year for both scattering and in-core research.

He also finished fourth to Flamingo in the 2000 Guineas.
Oak Ridge atomic plant<SEP>QualPro was founded in 1982 by Dr. Charles Holland. Holland previously worked for Union Carbide in the 1960s and 1970s at <ENT>Oak Ridge atomic plant<ENT> . They were producing carbon foam used in atomic bombs for the Atomic Energy Commission. 85 percent of the foam was defective and they were considering re-tooling the factory at a cost of $100 million. Instead, Holland questioned the workers and management team for ideas on how to decrease defects and tested 15 factors like the size and position of mixing blades. Holland’s multivariable experiments were based on the 1935 book The Design of Experiments and the work of two British statisticians that used multivariable testing to make better shells to shoot down German planes in World War II. The success rate of foam production increased from 15 percent to 60 percent, and eventually to 99 percent.
Abu Ghraib<SEP>In 2004, after Garrison had arrived safely in Kuwait preparing to return home, his year-long deployment was extended by the Pentagon 90 days. He was among 20,000 soldiers whose tours were extended because of the then-surge of violence in Iraq. He and his company were subsequently sent to the <ENT>Abu Ghraib<ENT> , where Garrison received an accidental yet fatal gunshot wound.
Gallipoli<SEP>He was born in the city of Erzurum as the son of an Ottoman Army officer, Abidin Bey, and the grandson of Ibrahim (1820–1895) and the great-grandson of Haci Ahmad (1790–1860). After the elementary school in Ordu and the military middle school in Erzincan, he graduated from the Kuleli military high school in Istanbul. He was a popular figure and was therefore nicknamed "Cemal Ağa" (big brother Cemal) since his childhood school years and onwards all his life.  Gürsel served in the Army for 45 years. During World War I, he participated in the Battle of Çanakkale in Dardanelles, <ENT>Gallipoli<ENT> as a lieutenant with the First Battery of the 12th Artillery Regiment in 1915 and received the War Medal. He later fought at the Palestine and Syria fronts in 1917 and became a prisoner of war by the British while suffering malaria during his command of the 5th Battery of the 41st Regiment on 19 September 1918. Gürsel was kept as a prisoner of war in Egypt until 6 October 1920. During his presidency much later, when interviewed by the foreign press as to why he had not learned English during his captivity, he somewhat regretfully recalled that he was so frustrated to be a captive, he protested and studied French in the British camp instead.
NYC<SEP>On January 20, 2015, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced a plan to build an AirTrain LaGuardia people mover, running along the Grand Central Parkway. This people mover would connect the station to <ENT>NYC<ENT> . In January 2017, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) released its 10-year capital plan that included AirTrain LaGuardia funding. On February 6, 2017, the PANYNJ announced that it had opened a four-week-long request for proposals to design three AirTrain stations, including the Willets Point station, as well as plan the right of way from Willets Point to the airport. In May 2017, Parsons Brinckerhoff was hired to design the AirTrain. Construction is projected to start in 2019, with passenger service in 2023.

San Siro<SEP>Cannavaro's progress as a player was such that he soon became a member of the first team alongside some of his childhood idols. Cannavaro's debut in Serie A came on 7 March 1993, in Turin, in a 4–3 defeat to Juventus. As a centre-back alongside Ferrara, he soon demonstrated his anticipation, tackling, distribution and his ability to start attacking plays after winning back possession. He scored his first career goal at <ENT>San Siro<ENT> , against Milan, on 8 January 1995. However, despite his promising performances, the post-Maradona Napoli were in desperate need of funds and were soon forced to sell Cannavaro to Parma, where Cannavaro won the UEFA Cup and Coppa Italia, and was named the Serie A Defender of the Year. Cannavaro remained at Napoli until 1995, earning nearly 60 total appearances with the club, scoring one goal.

Dachau<SEP>Ljotić was publicly denounced as a traitor by the Yugoslav government-in-exile and Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović in July 1942. He and other Serbian collaborationist officials left Belgrade in October 1944 and made their way to Slovenia, from where they intended to launch an assault against the Independent State of Croatia (NDH). Between March and April, Ljotić and Mihailović agreed to a last-ditch alliance against the Communist-led Yugoslav Partisans and their forces came together under the command of Chetnik General Miodrag Damjanović on 27 March. Ljotić was killed in an automobile accident on 23 April and was buried in Šempeter pri Gorici. His funeral service was jointly conducted by Bishop Nikolaj Velimirović and Serbian Orthodox Patriarch Gavrilo Dožić, whose release from <ENT>Dachau<ENT> Ljotić had secured the previous December. In early May, Damjanović led the SDK–Chetnik formations under his command into northwestern Italy, where they surrendered to the British and were placed in detainment camps. Many were later extradited to Yugoslavia, where several thousand were executed by the Partisans and buried in mass graves in the Kočevski Rog plateau. Others immigrated to the west, where they established émigré organizations intended to promote Zbor's political agenda. The antagonism between these groups and those affiliated with the Chetniks continued in exile.
South Bank<SEP>She was project director for redevelopments at <ENT>South Bank<ENT> designed by Richard Rogers, the National Maritime Museum Cornwall, Hackney Empire, the Horniman Museum and she led the design team for the remodelled King's Cross St. Pancras tube station.
Ludlow<SEP>During the Second Barons' War, she also proved to be a staunch Royalist and was instrumental in rallying the other Marcher lords to the side of King Henry III. It was Maud herself who devised a plan for the escape of Prince Edward after he had been taken hostage by Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester following the Battle of Lewes. On 28 May 1265, when the Prince was held in custody at Hereford Castle, Maud sent a party of horsemen to carry him away to Wigmore Castle while he was out in the open fields, some distance from the castle, taking exercise by racing horses with his unsuspecting guardians as she had instructed him to do in the messages she had smuggled to him previously. At a signal from one of the horsemen, Edward galloped off to join the party of his liberators, and they escorted him to Wigmore Castle, twenty miles away, where Maud was waiting. She supplied the Prince with food and drink before sending him on to <ENT>Ludlow<ENT> where he met up with the Earl of Gloucester who had defected to the side of the King.
Salisbury<SEP>The vicars were of two kinds: the vicars-choral who worked chiefly in the choir taking the main services and the chantry chaplains who performed services at the individual foundation altars though there was some overlapping of duties. Although the chapter followed the constitution of Lincoln, the form of divine service copied that of <ENT>Salisbury<ENT> . It is recorded that Elgin's vicars-choral were subject to disciplinary correction for shortcomings in the performance of the services, resulting in fines. More serious offences could end in corporal punishment, which was administered in the chapterhouse by the sub-dean and witnessed by the chapter. King Alexander II founded a chaplaincy for the soul of King Duncan I who died in battle with Macbeth near Elgin. The chapel most frequently referenced in records was St Thomas the Martyr, located in the north transept and supported by five chaplains. Other chaplaincies mentioned are those of the Holy Rood, St Catherine, St Duthac, St Lawrence, St Mary Magdalene, St Mary the Virgin and St Michael. By the time of Bishop Bur's episcopate (1362–1397), the cathedral had 15 canons (excluding dignitaries), 22 vicars-choral and about the same number of chaplains.
Wells<SEP>The Nidaros Cathedral West Front (Nidarosdomens Vestfront), which includes multiple sculptures, was the final portion of the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim, Norway that was restored. This is the cathedral's main facade and one of the most beautiful and ornate portions of the church. The restoration of the west face structure took place from 1901 through 1969, and the last statue was erected in 1983. This part of the church is also the most recent of the original cathedral constructions; archbishop Sigurd Eindrideson laid the cornerstone for the west front in 1248. The construction was not yet complete when the church was burnt in 1328. The original design for the west face is not known, but one can assume that it was never built to those original plans; it is reasonable to assume that a screen front similar to that used elsewhere was planned on the west. Screen fronts were often rectangular and served as a cover to conceal the rest of the church.  English cathedrals from the same period, among others Lincoln Cathedral, <ENT>Wells<ENT> and Salisbury Cathedral, had similar fronts. The west front had three entrances and is flanked by two smaller towers on each side of the façade.
Darlington<SEP>In 2003, Conway made his NASCAR Busch Series debut at Atlanta in the No. 22 for Bost Racing, qualifying 27th and finishing 33rd. In 2004 he made his career debut in the Winston West Series (now the K&N Pro Series West) at Fontana in the No. 28 Ford owned by Ernie Irvan, racing against Cup Series regular Ken Schrader and future Cup drivers Clint Bowyer and David Gilliland. Conway qualified and finished fifth after leading much of the race. Conway attempted three Busch Series races in 2004, failing to qualify for all three. In 2005, Conway signed to run the No. 03 Chevrolet for Gary Keller and Mark Smith, but failed to qualify for the first two races of the season. He made his only start of the season at <ENT>Darlington<ENT> in the No. 43 Channellock/Supra Boats Dodge for the Curb Agajanian Performance Group, where he finished 29th.

Springfield<SEP>W.N. Flynt Granite Co. was a granite quarry that opened in 1809 in Monson, Massachusetts to provide granite for new construction at <ENT>Springfield<ENT> .  In 1825, Rufus Flynt acquired the property, and began commercial quarrying with five employees. Flynt's son, William N. Flynt, took control of the company in 1839, and significantly expanded the quarrying operations.  In 1875, a two mile long spur track was constructed to connect the quarry to the New London Northern Railroad in Monson.  By 1888, the company employed over 200 workers, and produced about 30,000 tons of granite per year.  By 1900, the quarry employed nearly 500 and was one of the largest employers in Monson. The quarry closed in 1935.

Jamieson incurred a disability in the line of duty and retired on October 12, 1910. He was recalled to active duty, during World War I.
Williamsburg<SEP>In the 1920s and 1930s there was considerable interest in preserving buildings and history of colonial America, due in part to the country's celebration of its sesquicentennial and the stresses of waves of immigration, a world war, and the Great Depression. Sites relating to Founding Fathers were reconstructed in this era, notably Abraham Lincoln's former home in New Salem, Illinois, in the 1920s and the long-destroyed northern Virginia birthplace of George Washington, Wakefield, in 1930." Also in Virginia the Rockefeller family supported the restoration and reconstruction of <ENT>Williamsburg<ENT> .
Shinjuku<SEP>In JR-East commuter network at <ENT>Shinjuku<ENT> , transfers between Yamanote Line and Chūō-Sōbu Line use directional cross-platform interchange on two parallel island platforms.

Winchester<SEP>Bishop Gardiner died at Westminster on 12 November 1555.  He was temporarily buried in a vault at the church of St Mary Overyes and in February 1556 he was brought down in great estate to <ENT>Winchester<ENT> , where, after a number of ceremonies, a final funeral service was conducted on 28 February 1556, at which time it was recorded that he had not been buried and that no ground was broken, in the expectation that in due course his executors would build a chapel within the cathedral for his incarceration.  Some claim that his last words were Erravi cum Petro, sed non flevi cum Petro (Like Peter, I have erred, unlike Peter, I have not wept).
Sarum<SEP>In 1634, Hyde was made rector of Wylye and Little Langford, Wiltshire. In May 1637, Hyde became subdean and prebendary of <ENT>Sarum<ENT> , stall of South Grantham (4 March 1639). Like other members of his family, he was a staunch royalist and was sequestered from his livings under the Commonwealth, but reoccupied them at the Restoration. According to his epitaph, he gave generously to the repairs of the Cathedral after its desecration by the soldiers of the parliament.
Penshurst<SEP>In the 18th century Samuel Ireland published an illustrated book about a journey up the river, to the River Bewl at Bayham Abbey. The book's map shows some of the tributaries (unnamed). The illustrations include the castles at Queenborough, Upnor, Leybourne, Tonbridge and Hever; <ENT>Penshurst<ENT> ; and the bridges at Teston, Maidstone, Aylesford, East Farleigh, Barming, Branbridges and Tonbridge. The hop fields in the vicinity of the latter are also described; and the easterly River Len, which then supplied Maidstone with its piped water. The book states that Within about two miles of Tunbridge the Medway branches out into several small streams, five of which unite at the town ... having each its stone bridge.
El Escorial<SEP>After founding Triumph Bozell also founded the Society for the Christian Commonwealth whose educational arm, the Christian Commonwealth Institute headed by Dr. Warren Carroll, conducted annual classes, lectures, and seminars at <ENT>El Escorial<ENT> in Spain.

Sarum<SEP>The canons of Salisbury unanimously elected Herbert as Hubert's successor around 5 May 1194, and the archbishop confirmed the result on 29 April. Herbert was only in deacon's orders at the time; he was ordained as a priest on 4 June, the day before Hubert consecrated him in St Katherine's Chapel at Westminster. He was enthroned at Salisbury on 13 June. In December 1197, Herbert joined St Hugh of Lincoln in denying the king 300 knights for a year's service in his French wars; when Archbishop Hubert made the same request at the Council of Oxford in February of the next year, they successfully resisted. By the king's orders, all of Herbert's English lands were then seized, until he left to visit Richard personally in Normandy. He was permitted to return to England with his lands and title in June upon payment of a large fine. It was Herbert's idea to move the see from <ENT>Sarum<ENT> to the Salisbury Plain and he received permission from Richard to that effect, but the plan had to be abandoned after King John came to the throne. It was left to Herbert's brother and successor, Richard, to carry it out decades later, founding modern Salisbury in the process.
Rock Island<SEP>It was originally developed from the prototype T2 Light Tank built by <ENT>Rock Island<ENT> , which had a Vickers-type leaf spring suspension. The suspension was replaced by the superior vertical volute system in the T2E1 series of 1935. This was put into production with minor modifications as the M2A1 in 1936, with ten produced. The main pre-war version was the M2A2, with 239 produced, becoming the main tank in the US Army infantry units in the Interwar period. The Spanish Civil War showed that tanks armed only with machine guns were ineffective. This led to the M2A4 with a 37 mm gun as the main armament. A total of 375 were delivered, the last ten as late as April 1942.
Cassino<SEP>While fighting with the Polish army in Africa, Kluger met his future wife, Irene White, who was a driver for the British army.

The presbytery was built in order house a shrine to St. Etheldreda.
Springfield<SEP>The M39 was developed by <ENT>Springfield<ENT> , based on the World War II–era design of the German Mauser MG 213, a 20 mm (and 30 mm) cannon developed for the Luftwaffe, which did not see combat use. The same design inspired the 30mm British ADEN cannon and the French DEFA, but American designers chose a smaller 20 mm round to increase the weapon's rate of fire and muzzle velocity at the expense of hitting power. The 20×102mm round was later chosen by France for the M621 cannon.
Cosford<SEP>After attending RAF Staff College in 1953, a year-long posting as Command Signals Officer, AHQ Iraq followed.

Warwick<SEP>As the government searched for Fawkes's accomplices, Grant and the others engaged in a futile mission for support for the uprising.  They stole horses from <ENT>Warwick<ENT> , and further supplies from Hewell Grange, before stopping at Holbeche House.  The plotters laid in front of the fire some of the gunpowder they had collected, to dry out, but a stray spark ignited the powder, and in the resultant conflagration Grant was blinded.  Government forces besieged the house, and he was captured and taken to London.

Fawley<SEP>The name Langley means "long wood/clearing". Langley is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086, when it was held by Hugh of St Quentin. In 1372 John Baron of South Langley and Julia his wife held a messuage and land in South Langley. Thence the tenement passed indirectly to Richard Goolde and his wife Joan in 1413. John Ludlowe held the land in 1482. In 1500 the right of the Ludlowes to hold the manor (here so called for the first time) was fiercely disputed in the Court of Chancery by one William Fletcher. The Ludlowes evidently won, for in 1609 Sir Edward Ludlowe sold the manor of Langley to Sir Walter Longe. This united the manor of Langley to the manors of Cadlands (now beneath <ENT>Fawley<ENT> ) and Holbury, all three following the same descent henceforward. One part of the merged estate eventually became Langley Farm held by the Stanley family at the beginning of the 20th century.
Sarum<SEP>There are many Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments, including the henge monuments at Knowlton and the remains of a number of Iron Age settlements on the downs, most notably the hill fort at Badbury Rings (Vindocladia).

During the Saxon invasion of England the Romano-British kept the invaders out of Dorset by building Bokerley Dyke, a defensive ditch, across the Roman Road that runs across the downs from Dorchester to <ENT>Sarum<ENT> .
El Escorial<SEP>Ponce de León gained a reputation as a patron of ecclesiastical construction and of scholarship.  He assembled a large library that came to the attention of Philip II of Spain.  Many of these volumes would form the basis of the Biblioteca Laurentina in <ENT>El Escorial<ENT> .
Winchester<SEP>Loughborough is one of England's oldest schools, pre-dating similar institutions such as Harrow, Westminster and Stowe by a number of centuries.  Alongside <ENT>Winchester<ENT> , Harrow School, Monmouth School, Eton College, Dulwich College and Radley College, it is one of a small number of independent boarding schools in Britain that remain for boys only. Notable old boys include: Sir Thomas Abney who founded the Bank of England; Charles McCurdy who played a central role in the reforming Liberal Party of the early 20th century; Rev. George Davys who educated the young Queen Victoria and the flying ace Air Vice Marshal Johnnie Johnson who destroyed more Luftwaffe aircraft than any other British pilot.

The land owners before William fitz Nigel was Edward of Grappenhall and Wulfwin Chit, recorded in 1066. The value of the land in Clutton in 1066 was £1, in 1086 this was £0.4. Approximately 1.1 km north east of Clutton is a spring named Holy Well, situated at the settlement Holywell. It is said that the spring arose after the body of Saint Winifred was laid there on the way to <ENT>Shrewsbury<ENT> . This spring today now provides the drinking water for two houses.

Sarum<SEP>The house is built of Chilmark stone, a local stone also used for <ENT>Sarum<ENT> , and Wyatt is believed to have based his design on Pythouse, some seven miles (11 km) away at Newtown, near Tisbury.  The house is two-storied with symmetrically set chimney stacks and a central lantern.  The main (south) front has nine bays with an Ionic portico.  The rooms are planned around a spacious square hall with an imperial staircase to the first floor.  The house is one of the first in England to have a central heating system installed, which was achieved by pumping hot air from a boiler in the basement into the stairwell.
Hays<SEP>Following the war, Reno served briefly as an instructor at West Point. On October 31, 1865, he became judge advocate of the Military Commission in New Orleans, bringing his family with him. On December 4, 1865, he was assigned as provost marshal of the Freedmen's Bureau there. On August 6, 1866, he was reassigned to Fort Vancouver as assistant inspector general of the Department of the Columbia.

After several special assignments, he joined the consolidated regiment at Fort Abraham Lincoln in October 1875.
Shindand<SEP>After the initial shock of losing a major city and the defection of a whole division, the DRA reacted ruthlessly. The 4th and 15th armoured brigades were sent from Pul-e-Charki, but due to the distance they had to travel, Hafizullah Amin ordered Major General Sayyed Mukharam, commander of the Kandahar garrison to send an armoured force that could reach Herat faster. Mukharam's column of 30 tanks and 300 men arrived at Herat on March 20, waving green flags and Qurans, which induced the insurgents to believe that rebellion had spread to the whole country. The Khalq troops were thus allowed to pass, and recapture the city. The government forces then subjected Herat to an aerial bombardment with Ilyushin Il-28 bombers flying from <ENT>Shindand<ENT> , during which the city was heavily damaged, and thousands of Heratis were killed, though the exact death toll is uncertain: the lowest estimate runs at 3,000 to 4,000 dead, while the higher-case estimate reaches 25,000 dead. In 1992, a mass grave was uncovered, containing 2,000 bodies of those killed by the DRA repression.
Beverly<SEP>Symmetry made his racecourse debut on 12 April at Catterick Bridge Racecourse in Yorkshire where he finished second of the twelve runners behind Brough in a two-mile sweepstakes. On 25 May at York Racecourse, Symmetry was pitted against the 1797 St Leger winner Lounger in a race over one and a half miles in which he carried twelve pounds less than the older horse. Symmetry ran Lounger to a dead heat, but was beaten in a run-off. Three weeks later, Symmetry recorded his first win when he defeated five other three-year-olds in a one and a half mile sweepstakes at <ENT>Beverly<ENT> .

Ramstein<SEP>"Lonely Road of Faith" was the second released single from Kid Rock's 2001 album Cocky. Written in 1995, the song was released on the 2001 album Cocky. It received some minor attention on CMT, as the live version from CMT's Crossroads peaked at #2 on CMT Most Wanted Live and #17 on the CMT Top 20 Countdown. The MTV and VH1 Music Video was taken from Kid Rock's 2002 performance at the MTV USO special for troops stationed at Germany's <ENT>Ramstein<ENT> . The song was featured in two different WWE (then WWF) video packages when WCW's New World Order was sent by Vince McMahon to poison the WWF. The first video was a tribute to the history of the company. The second one mirrored the first video until the rap rock bridge and the video became scenes of New World Order's destruction. The song peaked at #15 on the Mainstream Rock Charts. An alternative version of the song appeared on Rock's 2010 EP Racing Father Time. It removed the rap rock bridge and had a Latino influence to it with a Spanish style gutair added.
Wembley<SEP>The Bad tour grossed $125 million (equivalent to $254 million in 2019). Jackson performed seven sold out shows at <ENT>Wembley<ENT> , beating the previous record held by Madonna, Bruce Springsteen and Genesis. The third concert on July 16, 1988 was attended by Diana, Princess of Wales and Prince Charles. In September 1988, Jackson was entered into the Guinness World Records, the first of three times from the tour alone.
Stowe<SEP>Kent introduced the Palladian style of architecture into England with the villa at Chiswick House, and also originated the 'natural' style of gardening known as the English landscape garden at Chiswick, <ENT>Stowe<ENT> in Buckinghamshire, and Rousham House in Oxfordshire. As a landscape gardener he revolutionised the layout of estates, but had limited knowledge of horticulture.
Blarney<SEP>Pyne was a substantial landowner in County Cork: he lived mainly at Waterpark, near Carrigaline, and also acquired estates at Ardra and Ballinaneala. In 1703 he bought <ENT>Blarney<ENT> , but sold it a few months later, apparently on the basis of a rumour (unfounded as it turned out) that the dispossessed owners, the MacCarthys, were about to recover it. He also owned an estate at Ashley in Surrey, where he died, and Great Codham Hall   near Braintree, Essex.  He is chiefly remembered nowadays as the builder of Ballyvolane House near Fermoy, although it was not completed until a considerable time after his death.

Hejaz<SEP>Hussein asked for an explanation of the Balfour Declaration and in January 1918 Commander David Hogarth, head of the Arab Bureau in Cairo, was dispatched to Jeddah to deliver a letter that was written by Sir Mark Sykes on behalf of the UK government to Hussein, who was now King of <ENT>Hejaz<ENT> . The Hogarth message assured Hussein "the Arab race shall be given full opportunity of once again forming a nation in the world" and referred to " ... the freedom of the existing population both economic and political ...". According to Isaiah Friedman and Kedourie, Hussein accepted the Balfour Declaration  while Charles D. Smith said both Friedman and Kedourie misrepresent documents and violate scholarly standards to reach their conclusions. Hogarth reported that Hussein "would not accept an independent Jewish State in Palestine, nor was I instructed to warn him that such a state was contemplated by Great Britain".
Winchester<SEP>Forbes was born on 3 February 1885 in East Hayes, Cheltenham, the only son of Sandford and Alice F. Kilby, He was educated at Bilton Grange near Rugby and <ENT>Winchester<ENT> .

Rock Island<SEP>The Renaissance Revival-style building was designed by L.G. Hallberg of Chicago and E.S. Hammatt of Davenport. A large central pediment with four two-story pilasters dominate in main façade of the building over the main entrance. Smaller pediments flank the ends of the façade and help to give the structure a balanced appearance. The exterior walls feature heavy textured stone on the ground level and smooth masonry walls on the second and third levels of the building. The buff-colored dolomite limestone was quarried near LeClaire, Iowa. It is the same quarry that produced the stone blocks that were used to build the shops on nearby <ENT>Rock Island<ENT> . The dome on top of the building is based on 16th-century Italian designs.
Ramstein<SEP>In February 1951, he became director of training in the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, at Headquarters U.S. Air Force.

Sarum<SEP>The canons of Salisbury unanimously elected Herbert as Hubert's successor around 5 May 1194, and the archbishop confirmed the result on 29 April. Herbert was only in deacon's orders at the time; he was ordained as a priest on 4 June, the day before Hubert consecrated him in St Katherine's Chapel at Westminster. He was enthroned at Salisbury on 13 June. In December 1197, Herbert joined St Hugh of Lincoln in denying the king 300 knights for a year's service in his French wars; when Archbishop Hubert made the same request at the Council of Oxford in February of the next year, they successfully resisted. By the king's orders, all of Herbert's English lands were then seized, until he left to visit Richard personally in Normandy. He was permitted to return to England with his lands and title in June upon payment of a large fine. It was Herbert's idea to move the see from <ENT>Sarum<ENT> to the Salisbury Plain and he received permission from Richard to that effect, but the plan had to be abandoned after King John came to the throne. It was left to Herbert's brother and successor, Richard, to carry it out decades later, founding modern Salisbury in the process.
Sudbury<SEP>The squadron arrived at its combat station, <ENT>Sudbury<ENT> the following month.  It flew its first combat mission on May 7.  It conducted strategic bombing missions against industrial facilities, including oil refineries and petroleum storage facilities at Dollbergen, Hamburg and Merseburg and factories at Mannheim and Weimar.  It also struck at transportation targets, such as marshalling yards near Köln, Mainz and Stuttgart; airfields at Kassel and Münster; and harbor installations at Bremen and Kiel. On 19 July 1944, along with the other B-24 units of the 92d Bombardment Wing, the squadron was taken off operations and began conversion to the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress. This would mark the beginning of the change of the 3d Bombardment Division to an All-B-17 unit.  The group completed its conversion and resumed operations by 1 August, while its Liberators were sent to depots in England for eventual transfer as replacements to 2d Bombardment Division groups.
Middlebury<SEP>The seminary formally opened in 1823 with two instructors and 14 enrolled students. The Revd. Reuel Keith, a graduate of <ENT>Middlebury<ENT> , Andover Seminary and a former rector of Bruton Parish Church, became the seminary's first elected professor in 1823. Wilmer also taught theology and church history from 1823–1826. In contrast with General Theological Seminary in New York City, VTS was for much of the 19th century associated with the more low-church or evangelical Episcopalian tradition. Emphasis was placed on preaching the plan of salvation, simpler worship styles and the development of student led missionary initiatives.
Edmonton<SEP>Spatializations are important for governance by linking affect and emotion to place and region.  They can be referenced in architecture and interior design, for example, in escapist consumer environments such as <ENT>Edmonton<ENT> 
Kalenberg<SEP>Despite the age difference, it was obviously a marriage without insurmountable conflicts, perhaps because Eric mostly stayed on his Erichsburg and <ENT>Kalenberg<ENT> , while Elisabeth resided at her wittum Münden.
Fort York<SEP>On 22 May, the couple attended an event hosted by the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, David Onley, at Queen's Park. After, the Duchess visited The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada, of which she is colonel-in-chief, laying at the armoury a wreath in memory of fallen Canadian soldiers, while the Prince of Wales saw the Digital Media Zone at Ryerson University, toured the construction site of the athletes' village for the 2015 Pan American Games (where Premier of Ontario Dalton McGuinty announced a portion of Front Street running through the village would be named Diamond Jubilee Promenade), visited the Yonge Street Mission, and met with the national leadership of the Assembly of First Nations.

Claydon<SEP>The design is attributed to Thomas Wright whose patron was a country landowner, Sir Charles Sedley. The house was designed around a 58 ft high hall beneath the central dome.  The hall was decorated with rococo plaster-work of a standard easily equal to that at <ENT>Claydon<ENT> .  In 1778 Sedley commissioned James Wyatt to undertake a number of alterations. Externally these included the installation of Venetian windows on the garden front and the lowering of balustrades below some others. Internally the redesign of the music room in a neo-Classical style illustrated how much taste had changed within a short period of time
Oak Ridge<SEP>Thomas Sterling is Professor of Computer Science at Indiana University, a Faculty Associate at California Institute of Technology, and a Distinguished Visiting Scientist at <ENT>Oak Ridge<ENT> . He received his PhD as a Hertz Fellow from MIT in 1984.

San Siro<SEP>Real Madrid's reign ended in the 1960–61 season when bitter rivals Barcelona dethroned them in the first round. Barcelona themselves, however, would be defeated in the final by Portuguese side Benfica 3–2 at Wankdorf Stadium. Reinforced by Eusébio, Benfica defeated Real Madrid 5–3 at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam and kept the title for a second consecutive season. Benfica wanted to repeat Real Madrid's successful run of the 1950s after reaching the showpiece event of the 1962–63 European Cup, but a brace from Brazilian-Italian José Altafini at the Wembley Stadium gave the spoils to Milan, making the trophy leave the Iberian Peninsula for the first time ever. Inter Milan beat an ageing-Real Madrid 3–1 in the Ernst-Happel-Stadion to win the 1963–64 season and replicate their local-rival's success. The title stayed in the city of Milan for the third year in a row after Inter beat Benfica 1–0 at their home ground, <ENT>San Siro<ENT> . Under the leadership of Jock Stein, Scottish club Celtic defeated Inter Milan 2–1 in the 1967 final to become the first British club to win the European Cup. The Celtic players that day subsequently became known as the "Lisbon Lions", all of whom were born within 30 miles of Glasgow.
Oak Ridge nuclear facility<SEP>The mouth of the Emory is into the Clinch River at the Tennessee Valley Authority's Kingston Power Plant, a coal-fired electric generation station initially developed during World War II, largely to power the uranium enrichment plants used to make the world's first atomic bomb at nearby <ENT>Oak Ridge nuclear facility<ENT> . The 2008 Kingston Fossil Plant coal fly ash slurry spill heavily polluted the Emory River and surrounding area.

Berkeley<SEP>In October 1398, Henry Bolingbroke was exiled for ten years by Richard II.  In February 1399, Henry's father, John of Gaunt, died, and in March 1399, Richard declared that Henry's inheritance was forfeit and that he was a traitor, permanently banished from the realm.  Then, in what was to prove a major strategic error, Richard proceeded with his army to Ireland.  This gave Henry the opportunity to return to England and, on 4 July 1399, he landed with a small force at Ravenspur.  From there, he marched into the Lancastrian heartlands of Yorkshire, building his forces.  At Bridlington, he was joined by the Earl of Northumberland and his son Henry Percy.  The army marched southwards and on 20 July reached Leicester.  Meanwhile, Richard's regent, Edmund, Duke of York had raised an army and was in Hertfordshire.  The Duke of York had little desire to fight, however, and detaching himself from the army, met Henry at <ENT>Berkeley<ENT> on 27 July.  Henry then marched his army to Bristol, where Richard's major supporters had gathered to await his return from Ireland.  The castle rapidly surrendered and Richard's chief counselors were promptly executed.

Sarum<SEP>In 1075 a council was held in London, under the presidency of Archbishop Lanfranc, which, reciting the decrees of the council of Sardica held in 347 and that of Laodicea held in 360 on this matter, ordered the bishop of the south Saxons to remove his see from Selsey to Chichester; the Wiltshire and Dorset bishop to remove his cathedra from Sherborne to <ENT>Sarum<ENT> , and the Mercian bishop, whose cathedral was then at Lichfield, to transfer it to Chester. Traces of the tribal and migratory system may still be noted in the designations of the Irish see of Meath (where the result has been that there is now no cathedral church) and Ossory, the cathedral church of which is at Kilkenny. Some of the Scottish sees were also migratory.
Trafford<SEP>The Bank of England retain their only offices outside London in Leeds, which as well as strong big data & medical software specialisms, also hosts BT and Royal Mail's secondary communication centres for the UK. A strong gaming industry in Leeds has produced global titles such as Grand Theft Auto and L.A. Noire.  Typically Southern upmarket department stores and shops have located new stores in the north; these include Harvey Nichols (opening first in Leeds, then Manchester, followed by Birmingham) and Selfridges in <ENT>Trafford<ENT> in 1998, Manchester in 2002 and Birmingham in 2003. Exclusive shopping destinations such as Leeds' Victoria Quarter have led to the city being dubbed 'The Knightsbridge of the North'.

Vancouver<SEP>Esther Clark was born on December 24, 1806 in Tioga County, Pennsylvania. After marrying husband Amos Short, the family moved West to Illinois in 1837. A few years later, the family moved further West to the Oregon territory in 1845. They settled near <ENT>Vancouver<ENT> in 1847 on a plot of land originally claimed by Henry Williamson, who had left the land in the care of the Hudson's Bay Company. This led to a conflict between the Shorts and the Hudson's Bay Company officials, as tensions remained high between British fur traders and American settlers in the area. The Treaty of Oregon specifically stipulated that Hudson's Bay's property rights were to be respected, and the British officers repeatedly tried to drive the Shorts back to the American territory South of the Columbia River.
Wells<SEP>In 1610, Sidney elected him to the mastership of the college and he was created D.D., having been admitted B.D. in 1603. He was now recognised as a moderate with Calvinist views, strongly attached to the Church of England; Thomas Fuller, who was his pupil at Sidney Sussex College, found him consistent. In 1615 Ward was made prebendary of <ENT>Wells<ENT> , and also archdeacon of Taunton. On 21 February 1618 he was appointed prebendary of York, and in the following year was one of the English delegates to the synod of Dort.

Rugby<SEP>Faber was educated at <ENT>Rugby<ENT> and Christ Church, Oxford. He gained a First in Classical Moderations in 1910 and a First in Literae Humaniores ('Greats') in 1912. In 1913 he joined the Oxford University Press.
Edmonton<SEP>The theme park became popular in the 1980s and the technology of thrill is the main attraction. In Toronto, Canada's Wonderland, Canada's largest, opened its doors to the public in 1981 and is now tied for second place in North America as the theme park with the most roller coasters (List of roller coasters at Canada's Wonderland). Galaxyland the world's largest indoor amusement park located in <ENT>Edmonton<ENT> which opened in 1981 has garnered continent-wide attention. The most popular thrill ride, the Mindbender (Galaxyland) is the largest indoor triple-loop roller coaster in North America. The Drop of Doom was another featured attraction until closed in the early 2000s. The Mall's World Waterpark, which opened in 1985 offers bathers a chance to cavort in the world's largest indoor wave pool. The technology of auto racetrack design and construction has been put to good use in Montreal at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, Canada's premier auto race track and home of the Canadian Grand Prix Formula 1 motor car races since 1978.

Kilkenny<SEP>Butler House was built so that it was completed by 1786 as the Dower house for <ENT>Kilkenny<ENT> . It was built by Walter Butler, 16th Earl of Ormonde for his wife to live in when their son John Butler, 17th Earl of Ormonde inherited the title. The first occupant was Lady Eleanor Butler, though it isn't certain if she and her husband moved in before his death. Her son John was the 17th Earl, who regained the title and re-energised the family fortunes, and her daughter, Eleanor was one of the Ladies of Llangollen.
Harewood<SEP>Highclere Castle, Hampshire, with its large tower, was remodelled between about 1842 and 1850, in Elizabethan style, for Henry Herbert, 3rd Earl of Carnarvon. The building was completely altered externally, with the plain Georgian structure being virtually rebuilt. However, little of the interior is by Barry, because his patron died in 1849 and Thomas Allom completed the work in 1861. At Duncombe Park, Yorkshire, Barry designed new wings, which were added between in 1843 and 1846 in the English Baroque style of the main block. At <ENT>Harewood<ENT> he remodelled the John Carr exterior between 1843 and 1850, adding an extra floor to the end pavilions, and replacing the portico on the south front with Corinthian pilasters. Some of the Robert Adam interiors were remodelled, with the dining room being entirely by Barry, and he created the formal terraces and parterres surrounding the house.

Vancouver<SEP>The first recorded encounter with European descendants for the Shasta came in 1826. A Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) expedition under Peter Skene Ogden departed from <ENT>Vancouver<ENT> to trap beavers in the Klamath Mountains. Arriving from the east, Ogden's party was favorably received by Shasta. Ogden was disappointed by the small number of beaver in the mountainous region and shifted the party north to the Rogue Valley across the Siskiyous. Shasta guides accompanied them until shortly before modern Talent. The HBC continued to send expeditions southward through the Klamath Mountains to harvest beaver populations in Alta California. These groups of fur trappers and their families traveled along the Siskiyou Trail which traversed portions of the Shasta homelands.

Berkeley<SEP>Henry joined the revolt of Edward's wife Isabella of France and Mortimer in 1326, pursuing and capturing Edward at Neath in South Wales. Following Edward's deposition at the Parliament of Kenilworth in 1326 and reputed murder at <ENT>Berkeley<ENT> , Thomas's conviction was posthumously reversed and Henry regained possession of the Earldoms of Lancaster, Derby, Salisbury and Lincoln that had been forfeit for Thomas's treason. His restored prestige led to him knighting the young King Edward III of England before his coronation. Mortimer lost support over the Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton that formalised Scotland's independence, and his developing power in the Welsh Marches provoked jealousy from the barons. When Mortimer called a parliament to make his new powers and estates permanent with the title of Earl of March in 1328, Henry led the opposition and held a counter-meeting. In response, Mortimer ravaged the lands of Lancaster and checked the revolt. Edward III was able to assume control in 1330 but Henry's further influence was restricted by poor health and blindness for the last fifteen years of his life.
Parafield<SEP>The prefix "Para" is derived from the Kaurna word "Pari" meaning a stream of flowing water, which could refer to either the Little Para River or Dry Creek.

The flat land between Dry Creek and the Little Para River is sometimes called the Para Plains and the facing hills the Para Hills.
Felbrigg<SEP>The 6th Duke had "conceived a violent dislike for Smithson", the husband of his granddaughter, and wrote to her stating "You are descended by many generations from the most ancient families in England and it is you who doth add ancient blood to Sir Hugh Smithson’s family. He adds not so ancient blood to your family". He was determined to prevent Smithson from inheriting any of the Percy lands and wished to make as his sole heir his grandson Sir Charles Wyndham, whose ancient family originated at <ENT>Felbrigg<ENT> in Norfolk and had married into the nobility, for example his ancestor Sir John Wyndham (d.1503) had married Lady Margaret Howard, 4th daughter of John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk, KG, Earl Marshal (c.1425-1485). As part of his plan he petitioned the king to grant him the additional title of Earl of Northumberland, with special remainder to Wyndham. The plan was opposed by his son the future 7th Duke, who petitioned the king against, and succeeded at least in delaying the drawing up of the necessary letters patent. The 6th Duke died in 1748 before the letters patent were drawn up and the 7th Duke put into effect a similar scheme, which split the Percy inheritance between his own son-in-law Smithson and his late father's choice of heir, Sir Charles Wyndham.

Warwick<SEP>Going into this match, Birmingham were bottom of the table with only one win in ten games. The previous week, forward Robin Stubbs had dislocated his shoulder, and during a Football League Cup replay unhelpfully scheduled for the Monday night, 48 hours before the Roma match, England international Trevor Smith had to leave the field with a thigh strain as Birmingham lost to Third Division side Swindon Town. The 19-year-old Winston Foster, who had previously been used only at right-back, took Smith's place at centre-half, alongside Hennessey and Malcolm Beard in a half-back line composed entirely of teenagers.

Fort York<SEP>In 1837, the British Government funded the installation of a magnetic observatory at Greenwich. The Association continued to press for the construction of similar observatories around the world, and in 1838 their suggestions were accepted by the Government and funds were provided. In 1839 the British Government and the Royal Society prepared four expeditions to build magnetic observation stations in Cape Town; St. Helena; Hobart, Tasmania and (eventually) Toronto, Ontario. Teams of Royal Artillery officers were sent out to take the measurements. The team assigned to Canada originally planned to build their observatory on Saint Helen's Island off Montreal, but the local rocks proved to have a high magnetic influence, and the decision was made to move to Toronto instead. The team arrived in 1839, and set up camp at <ENT>Fort York<ENT> in a disused barracks while construction started on new buildings.  The observatory was given 10 acres (4.0 ha) of land to the west of King's College; the Ontario Legislature now occupies the area on which the college was located.

Wells<SEP>St Paul's Cathedral is built in a restrained Baroque style which represents Wren's rationalisation of the traditions of English medieval cathedrals with the inspiration of Palladio, the classical style of Inigo Jones, the baroque style of 17th century Rome, and the buildings by Mansart and others that he had seen in France. It is particularly in its plan that St Paul's reveals medieval influences.  Like the great medieval cathedrals of York and Winchester, St Paul's is comparatively long for its width, and has strongly projecting transepts. It has much emphasis on its facade, which has been designed to define rather than conceal the form of the building behind it. In plan, the towers jut beyond the width of the aisles as they do at <ENT>Wells<ENT> . Wren's uncle Matthew Wren was the Bishop of Ely, and, having worked for his uncle, Wren was familiar with the unique octagonal lantern tower over the crossing of Ely Cathedral, which spans the aisles as well as the central nave, unlike the central towers and domes of most churches. Wren adapted this characteristic in designing the dome of St Paul's. In section St Paul's also maintains a medieval form, having the aisles much lower than the nave, and a defined clerestory.
Arecibo<SEP>The Senate of Puerto Rico approved a resolution in June 2008, co-sponsored by Senate President Kenneth McClintock and Senate Minority Leader José Luis Dalmau, urging the United States Mint to select an image of <ENT>Arecibo<ENT> for Puerto Rico's commemorative quarter.

Whistler<SEP>Not all membership based ski areas operate with the high costs that the Yellowstone Club has become known for since opening its doors in 2000. Vermont's Hermitage Club features an 80,000 square foot clubhouse with a lap pool, spa, bowling alley and teen center but has a more modest $75,000 initiation fee. HoliMont ski area in Ellicottville, NY began as a 13 family club in 1962 and is now the largest private ski area by members. HoliMont charges $3,600 per year per family and sells day tickets to visitors on non-holiday weekdays. In comparison, an individual season pass to <ENT>Whistler<ENT> , a public resort and an official 2010 Winter Olympics host venue, costs the average adult $1,795 Canadian. Massachusetts' Mount Greylock Ski Club is another  private ski club that stands in contrast to the high levels of exclusion and opulent facilities of the Yellowstone Club. As one of the oldest ski areas in the United States, Greylock exists on the slopes of one of Massachusetts highest peaks but only operates two small surface lifts, one powered by a salvaged Ford motor. In 1950, when membership cost $3, Greylock had a 2,000 person membership and a waiting list. Today Greylock has ample space with only 150 current members at a family rate of $150.

Vancouver<SEP>One of the first ferries operating in what is now Portland, Oregon was Switzler's ferry that crossed the Columbia River in 1846 between the Hudson's Bay Company's <ENT>Vancouver<ENT> and the south bank of the river. Then in 1848, Stephen Coffin established a ferry on the Willamette using a wooden platform over canoes. The Stark Street Ferry operated from 1855 until ferry traffic declined due to the opening of the Morrison Bridge in 1887, and the removal of tolls on the bridge in 1895. In 1888, the completion of a railroad bridge (the original Steel Bridge) allowed the Oregon & California Railroad to cease using their passenger ferry, which had begun operations in 1870, using barges to move the trains across the river.
