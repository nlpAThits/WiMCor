Irish independence<SEP>During <ENT>Irish independence<ENT> , the area was rocked by sectarian violence, partly prompted by the guerilla war raging between the Irish Republican Army and British forces, but also influenced by economic and social pressures. By mid-1920 there was severe sectarian rioting in the city. Many lives were lost and in addition many Catholics and Protestants were expelled from their homes during this communal unrest. After a week's violence, a truce was negotiated by local politicians on both unionist and republican sides.
Irish independence<SEP>In Northern Ireland, towns and cities have long been segregated along ethnic, religious and political lines. Northern Ireland's two main communities are its Irish nationalist-republican community (who mainly self-identify as Irish or Catholic) and its unionist-loyalist community (who mainly self-identify as British or Protestant). Ghettos emerged in Belfast during the riots that accompanied <ENT>Irish independence<ENT> . For safety, people fled to areas where their community was the majority.

Kronstad<SEP>Within this left-wing discontent, the most large-scale events were the worker's <ENT>Kronstad<ENT> and the anarchist led Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine uprising which controlled an area known as the Free Territory.
Aughrim<SEP>A member of the King's Privy Council, Purcell was the right-hand man to Patrick Sarsfield, Earl of Lucan. In 1687 Nicholas Purcell raised a troop of horse to support King James II — they were called the "Yellow Horse," probably on account of the uniform of the men. Nicholas fought at the Battle of the Boyne and at <ENT>Aughrim<ENT> , and was a signatory to the Treaty of Limerick. He did not flee to Europe after Limerick but remained in Ireland to fight for the rights of Roman Catholics.
Kent<SEP>On May 8, 1970, near the intersection of Wall Street and Broad Street and at New York City Hall, a riot started when about 200 construction workers mobilized by the New York State AFL-CIO labor federation attacked about 1,000 high school and college students and others protesting <ENT>Kent<ENT> , the Cambodian Campaign, and the Vietnam War. Some attorneys, bankers, and investment analysts from nearby Wall Street investment firms tried to protect many of the students but were themselves attacked, and some onlookers reported that the police stood by and did nothing. Although more than seventy people were injured, including four policemen, only six people were arrested. The following day, Lindsay severely criticized the police for their lack of action. Police Department labor leaders later accused Lindsay of "undermining the confidence of the public in its Police Department" by his statements and blamed the inaction on inadequate preparations and "inconsistent directives" in the past from the Mayor's office. Several thousand construction workers, longshoremen and white-collar workers protested against the mayor on May 11 and again on May 16. Protesters called Lindsay "the red mayor", "traitor", "Commie rat", and "bum". The Mayor described the mood of the city as "taut".
Tower Hill<SEP>On 1 December 1944, Empire Dace struck a mine off Missolonghi, Greece and sank with the loss of 45 lives. She was carrying 22 crew, 12 DEMS gunners and 100 passengers. Those lost on Empire Dace are commemorated at <ENT>Tower Hill<ENT> , London.
Aughrim<SEP>His third wife was  Frances Sackville (daughter of Richard Sackville, 5th Earl of Dorset and Lady Frances Cranfield) by whom he had another daughter, Frances. Frances married Ulick Burke, 1st Viscount Galway a Jacobite Colonel in the Irish Army, who was killed at <ENT>Aughrim<ENT> in 1691. She married secondly Henry Fox and had issue including George Fox-Lane, 1st Baron Bingley, the eventual heir to the Lanesborough estates.
Daytona<SEP>In 2001, Maassen was paired with Lucas Luhr at Alex Job Racing. They would win at Texas and the 12 Hours of Sebring in the GT class in a season otherwise dominated by the BMW M3 GTRs. Maassen also raced prototypes, at <ENT>Daytona<ENT> for Champion Racing, and for Dick Barbour Racing at Le Mans.
Navarino<SEP>The Obelisk at Karolinenplatz was built in 1833 by Leo von Klenze as a memorial for the 30,000 Bavarian soldiers who lost their lives during the French invasion of Russia. The monument is 29 meters high and constructed out of bronze plates over brick. The metal was obtained from guns of the Turkish battle-ships sunk in <ENT>Navarino<ENT> on October 20, 1827. The purpose of the Amerika Haus at 3 Karolinenplatz is to focus on culture as a center for cultural exchange between Bavaria and the United States. The Börse München is also situated at Karolinenplatz.
Mysore<SEP>Gaarudi Gombe is a folk dance prevalent in the state of Karnataka, India. Dancers adorn themselves with giant doll-suits made of bamboo sticks. The term Gaarudi-Gombe means magical-doll in the native language, Kannada. This dance is performed during major festivals and also in the procession held during the festivities of <ENT>Mysore<ENT> . This dance is also known as Tattiraya in the coastal districts of Karnataka. The term Tattiraya means a person carrying a doll made of bamboo sticks.
Potsdam<SEP>During Prussian and German rule, Wałcz under the newly given name Deutsch Krone was part of the province of West Prussia created in 1773. After the First World War it was one of the few towns of historical Greater Poland that were not included in the borders of Poland after regaining independence in 1918. Deutsch Krone, having a predominantly German population, remained part of Weimar Germany and was part of the Grenzmark Posen–Westpreussen until 1938 and then was assigned to Pommern. The town was occupied by Red Army on 12 February 1945. After the end of World War II, the town was put under Polish administration according to <ENT>Potsdam<ENT> and renamed to its historic name Wałcz. Its German inhabitants were expelled.
Aughrim<SEP>A large French fleet entered the English Channel, and gained a success over the combined British and Dutch fleets on July 10, 1690 in the Battle of Beachy Head, which was not followed up by vigorous action. During the following year, while James's cause was finally ruined in Ireland, the main French fleet was cruising in the Bay of Biscay, principally for the purpose of avoiding battle. During the whole of 1689, 1690 and 1691, British squadrons were active on the Irish coast -helping to win the Williamite war in Ireland for the allies. One raised the siege of Derry in July 1689, and another convoyed the first British and Dutch forces sent over under the Duke of Schomberg. Immediately after Beachy Head in 1690, a part of the Channel fleet carried out an expedition under the Earl of Marlborough, which took Cork and reduced a large part of the south of the island. William of Orange himself arrived in Ireland in 1690 with veteran Dutch and allied troops, defeating the James II at the battle of the Boyne -an engagement largely decided by Dutch infantry. The war was ended in Anglo-Dutch favour in 1691, when Dutch general Ginkel destroyed the Franco-Irish army at <ENT>Aughrim<ENT> .
Irish Republic<SEP>Barry enlisted in the Royal Field Artillery on 30 June 1915 and was sent to the military depot at Athlone for basic training. After six months he was posted to the Mesopotamian front (modern Iraq) on 21 January 1916.  He fought from January 1916 in Mesopotamia (then part of the Ottoman Empire). On 1 March he was raised to the rank of corporal.  In April while his brigade was attempting to break the Turkish Siege of Kut where the British after heavy losses were forced to surrender,  Barry first heard of <ENT>Irish Republic<ENT> . Presumably in reaction to the British response to the Rising, Barry dropped his rank in protest on 26 May and reverted to his original rank of gunner, which rank he held until the end of the war.
Taiping Tianguo<SEP>In the late 1850s, Nie was in the service of Yuan Jiasan (the father of Yuan Shikai) against rebel forces in the Nian Rebellion, under whom he was commissioned as a lieutenant and then in the Huai Army in the suppression of <ENT>Taiping Tianguo<ENT> , at the end of which he was promoted to general.
Taiping Tianguo<SEP>Hawley returned to San Francisco to attend City College there in 1865. He also began to read law at an attorney's office. He apparently completed the coursework he wanted by the spring of 1867. However, he then ran into some difficulty in San Francisco, the details of which "have not been preserved." According to one account, he ran away to sea and ended up in China, on the losing side of <ENT>Taiping Tianguo<ENT> . Supposedly, he escaped death after being captured by government forces through the good offices of the British consul. In any case, Hawley returned to the Boise Basin in 1868, and again took up mining and prospecting.
Irish independence<SEP>During <ENT>Irish independence<ENT> , local companies of the Irish Republican Army took Trim RIC Barracks, a large structure located on the current site of the Castle Arch Hotel, secured the arms from the barracks and then burnt down the Barracks. A large part of the town was burned as a reprisal by the British Crown forces on 26 September 1920. The local members were drawn from Trim, Longwood, Ballivor and South Meath in general. The Lalor brothers form Castle St. were prominent members as well as the Duignans from High St and the Proctors. Records of the adventures of the Lalors rest in Navan library and recount the tales of one of the brothers hiding in the recently dug grave of Fr. Woods in the churchyard. Local memories recall the townspeople sheltering down by the Boyne for a few nights as the Black 'n' Tans and Auxiliaries burnt out prominent businesses and the town hall. Footage of the burning of J&E Smyth can be viewed on the 'Pathe' website. Many of the townspeople were traumatised for the rest of their lives; many children in Trim were not allowed to play with guns; memories of the B'n'Ts dangling grenades outside their windows as the Town Hall burnt and peeled the paint off their doors at Castle St. remained for a long time. The newspapers reported the burning of the barracks and the subsequent looting and burning of the town and follow-up operations by the local IRA.
Tarawa<SEP>Alexander "Sandy" Bonnyman Jr. (May 2, 1910 – November 22, 1943) was a United States Marine Corps officer who was killed in action on Betio Atoll in the Gilbert Islands during World War II. A combat engineer, he received the Medal of Honor, Purple Heart, Presidential Unit Citation, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with three Bronze Stars and the World War II Victory Medal posthumously for his actions during the strategically important assault on a Japanese bombproof shelter during <ENT>Tarawa<ENT> .
Taiping<SEP>Mandarin is a  Robert Elegant historical novel published by Simon & Schuster in 1983. It is set in China during <ENT>Taiping<ENT> . It is the third to appear of Elegant's "Imperial China Trilogy", the first being Dynasty (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1977) and the second being Manchu (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1980).
Schengen<SEP>Greece joined in 1981, Portugal and Spain following in 1986. In 1985, <ENT>Schengen<ENT> paved the way for the creation of open borders without passport controls between most member states and some non-member states. In 1986, the European flag began to be used by the EEC and the Single European Act was signed.
Sturgis<SEP>On September 12, 2019, the Speedway announced motorcycle racing will return on the FIM-approved circuit with the MotoAmerica Championship of Indianapolis, which will be part of the Motorcycles on Meridian motorcycle festival.  The Indianapolis festival will join <ENT>Sturgis<ENT> (American Flat Track) and Daytona Beach Bike Week (Daytona 200 American Sportbike Racing Association championship) as hosts of major motorcycle racing events that run with motorcycle festivals.  It will mark MotoAmerica's first race at the Speedway since 2015, and the first as a stand-alone race with the five major championships participating.
New York<SEP>On October 23, 2011, he took out a full-page ad in The Boston Globe, thanking Red Sox fans and the team's owners for their support. Two days later, the Cubs officially introduced Epstein as president of baseball operations. While the Red Sox were already a winning team when Epstein was hired in Boston, the Cubs were coming off a fifth-place finish in the National League Central and had a depleted farm system. The Cubs finished in last place in the National League Central for the first three years of Epstein's presidency, as the focus was to acquire young talent rather than maximize short-term competitiveness. After a three-year, top-to-bottom rebuild, the Cubs clinched a playoff berth in 2015; their first since 2008. They advanced to the National League Championship Series, where they were swept by <ENT>New York<ENT> .
Boston<SEP>The area is believed to have been named after Preston, Lancashire, England or Thomas Preston, a British army officer involved in <ENT>Boston<ENT> at the beginning of the American Revolution. It was among the areas where the Crown granted lands to Black Loyalists from the Thirteen Colonies; it had promised them freedom and resettled more than 3,000 former slaves in Nova Scotia. Reflecting its early history, Preston has the largest percentage of black people of any area in Canada; 69.4% of its population is black.
Tarawa<SEP>Melvin Alvah Traylor Jr. (December 16, 1915 – February 11, 2008) was an American ornithologist. He was the son of Chicago banker Melvin Alvah Traylor and Mrs. Dorothy Y. Traylor. Traylor was Lieutenant with the marines and served on Guadalcanal during World War II in 1942 where he was awarded with the Silver Star medal. As a Marine Corps officer, Mel was severely injured during <ENT>Tarawa<ENT> in the Pacific theatre, where he lost one eye and suffered arm and upper body wounds during the famous beach assault. After the war Traylor continued his work for the Field Museum which he had started in 1937. He made expeditions to Africa (in collaboration with Austin L. Rand), to South America, and to Asia. In 1960 he was among the members of the World Book Encyclopedia Scientific Expedition to the Himalaya led by Sir Edmund Hillary. In 1956 Traylor became assistant curator of birds in the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. Since his retirement in the 1980s he was working as curator emeritus for the Field Museum.
Kosovo<SEP>At the end of March 1999, after negotiations at Rambouillet had broken down, NATO launched Operation Allied Force to impose a resolution of <ENT>Kosovo<ENT> . Rugova spent the first few weeks of the war under virtual house arrest, along with his family, in Pristina. At the start of April 1999, Rugova was forcefully taken to Belgrade, where he was shown on Serbian state television meeting Milošević and calling for an end to the war.
Monterey<SEP>Sean Jones (born May 29, 1978 in Warren, Ohio) is an American trumpeter and composer featured on the 2007 Grammy Award-winning album Turned to Blue by Nancy Wilson. As a bandleader, Jones has released seven albums under the Mack Avenue Records label. He performs with his own groups both nationally and internationally. Jones often plays at music venues and jazz festivals such as <ENT>Monterey<ENT> , Detroit International Jazz Festival, the Vail Jazz Festival and Montreal International Jazz Festival.
Indy<SEP>The Imperial's new engine was slightly larger than the company's standard straight 6. It was a 288.6 cu in (4.7 L) six-cylinder with seven bearing blocks and pressure lubrication of 92 brake horsepower (69 kW). Springs were semi-elliptic in the front. The car set a transcontinental speed record in the year it was introduced, driving more than 6,500 miles (10,460 km) in the week. The car was chosen as the pace car for the <ENT>Indy<ENT> . The model was designated E-80, the 80 being after the "guaranteed" 80 miles per hour (129 km/h) all-day cruising speed. Acceleration was also brisk, breaking 20 seconds to 60 miles per hour (97 km/h). Four-speed transmission was added in 1930. The attention to luxury and multiple bodystyles was a similar approach to one Mr. Chrysler used as president of the Buick Motor Company, his employer from 1911 to 1919.
Sandwich<SEP>Upon his father's death, Anson abandoned law and began the first of many travels to the continent, as was then the fashion for young men of fortune and taste. In 1732 Anson and his friend <ENT>Sandwich<ENT> formed a riotous dining-club called the Society of the Dilettanti, which also had the more serious purpose of encouraging study of Greek architecture. In 1740 Thomas briefly joined his brother George on The Centurion, as he and his crew began their circumnavigation of the globe. Anson left them in order to travel to Egypt. This qualified him for the Egyptian Society and the Divan Society, the latter being a wild drinking-club of which Lord Dashwood and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu were avid members.
Sebring<SEP>He began racing with the SCCA in 1987. Said was named SCCA rookie of the year in 1988.  In 1991 he began driving for Baer Racing, later to become Baer Brake Systems. Upon Baer's withdrawal from the series to focus on the manufacture of brakes in 1992, Said got another big ride driving in the IMSA series in 1993 driving a BMW M3. He won the 1997 and 1998 24 Hours of Daytona and 1998 <ENT>Sebring<ENT> in IMSA. He also became the first American to win the 24 Hours Nürburgring in 2005 driving a BMW Motorsport-entered BMW M3 GTR with co-drivers Pedro Lamy, Duncan Huisman and Andy Priaulx.
Petersburg<SEP>The Battle of Chaffin's Farm and New Market Heights, also known as Laurel Hill and combats at Forts Harrison, Johnson, and Gilmer, was fought in Virginia on September 29–30, 1864, as part of <ENT>Petersburg<ENT> in the American Civil War.
Nürnberg<SEP>Kaltenbrunner was the highest-ranking member of the SS to face trial at the <ENT>Nürnberg<ENT> , where he was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity. He was sentenced to death and executed by hanging in October 1946.
Glastonbury<SEP>Michael Parkinson saw coverage of the band performing at <ENT>Glastonbury<ENT> and invited them onto his TV show. Razorlight performed "Golden Touch" with a gospel choir in front of the Parkinson studio audience and guest Tom Cruise. After 2004's constant touring Borrell was placed at No. 4 in NME's Cool List and Razorlight won Best New Act at 2004's Q Awards and the Best New Band category at the NME Awards in February 2005. French fashion brand Dior's creative director Hedi Slimane based his 2005 Autumn/Winter collection on Borrell and Pete Doherty and chose Razorlight to write music for the Paris show.
Selma<SEP>Although he once expressed his personal opposition to demonstrations during the Civil Rights Movement, Spellman declined J. Edgar Hoover's requests to condemn Martin Luther King, Jr. and funded the trip of a group of New York priests and Religious Sisters to <ENT>Selma<ENT> . He opposed racial discrimination in public housing but also the social activism of such priests as Daniel Berrigan and his brother, Philip Berrigan, as well as a young Melkite priest, David Kirk.
Glastonbury<SEP>"Pear cider" has in recent years been used as an alternative name for alcoholic drinks containing pear juice, in preference to the term perry. According to the BBC, the term was first used when Brothers Cider, a product industrially made from pear concentrate, rather than the traditional method using perry pears, was sold at <ENT>Glastonbury<ENT> in 1995: nobody understood what perry was and were told that it was "like cider, but made from pears".
Indy<SEP> <ENT>Indy<ENT> kept a connection to European racing, running to Grand Prix regulations between 1923 and 1930, and from 1938 until 1953. In the late 1920s, efforts were made to refer to the 500 as the American Grand Prize. The Grand Prize trophy was awarded to the winner of the Indianapolis 500 between 1930 and 1936, when it was replaced by the Borg-Warner Trophy. The race was included in the World Championship from 1950 through 1960.
New York<SEP>Nomo pitched poorly in 1998, starting the season 2–7 and was dealt to <ENT>New York<ENT> . His performance did not improve and was released that season. In 1999, he signed with the Chicago Cubs and made three starts for their Triple-A minor league team before refusing to make further starts in the minors, and received a contract with the Milwaukee Brewers, where he went 12–8 with a 4.54 ERA. He reached the 1,000 strikeout mark in 1999, the third fastest in major league history. The Brewers waived him after contract issues and the Philadelphia Phillies claimed him, then granted him free agency only 24 hours later after more contract issues. Finally signed by the Detroit Tigers in 2000, he went 8–12 with a 4.74 ERA and was again released.
Cheltenham<SEP>In March 2015, Pendleton announced her intention to become a jockey with the aim of competing at the Foxhunter Chase at the <ENT>Cheltenham<ENT> , with guidance from horse trainer Paul Nicholls.

Isle of Wight<SEP>Ford Farm near Godshill was the site of the first <ENT>Isle of Wight<ENT> in 1968. It attracted 10,000 people to see acts such as Jefferson Airplane and the mystical Arthur Brown.
Selma<SEP>The movement was characterized by major campaigns of civil resistance. Between 1955 and 1968, acts of civil disobedience and nonviolent protest produced crisis situations between activists and government authorities. Federal, state, and local governments, businesses, and communities often had to respond immediately to these situations that highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of protest and/or civil disobedience included boycotts such as the successful Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955–1956) in Alabama; "sit-ins" such as the influential Greensboro sit-ins (1960) in North Carolina; marches, such as <ENT>Selma<ENT> (1965) in Alabama; and a wide range of other nonviolent activities.
Gettysburg<SEP>Alexander was the officer in charge of the massive artillery bombardment preceding Pickett's Charge, on the third day of <ENT>Gettysburg<ENT> , and is also noted for his early use of signals and observation balloons during combat. After the Civil War, he taught mathematics at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, spent time in Nicaragua, and wrote extensive memoirs and analyses of the war, which have received much praise for their insight and objectivity.  His Military Memoirs of a Confederate were published in 1907. An extensive personal account of his military training and his participation in the Civil War was rediscovered long after his death and published in 1989 as Fighting for the Confederacy.
Iwo Jima<SEP>The memorial was inspired by the iconic 1945 photograph of six Marines raising a U.S. flag atop Mount Suribachi during <ENT>Iwo Jima<ENT> in World War II taken by Associated Press combat photographer Joe Rosenthal. Upon first seeing the photograph, sculptor Felix de Weldon created a maquette for a sculpture based on the photo in a single weekend at Patuxent River Naval Air Station in Maryland, where he was serving in the Navy. He and architect Horace W. Peaslee designed the memorial. Their proposal was presented to Congress, but funding was not possible during the war. In 1947, a federal foundation was established to raise funds for the memorial.
Indianapolis<SEP>In single seater, open wheel racing series such as Formula One and the IndyCar Series, as well as to a lesser extent in sports car racing, a technique known as slipstreaming is used. Along a long straight a car following close behind another uses the slipstream created by the lead car to close the gap between them, hoping to be able to overtake the leader under braking for the next corner, or if he has a straightline speed advantage, to pass on the straight. However it is very difficult for cars to follow each other close together in fast corners as the "dirty" (turbulent) air that comes off the lead car unbalances the trailing car as its aerodynamic devices provide less grip. 4-time <ENT>Indianapolis<ENT> winner Rick Mears was quoted by motorsport.com writer David Malsher in 2015 as saying "The fact is, grip created by aerodynamic downforce is our enemy... At the moment, the downforce is so great that it masks the handling and hurts the racing."
Potsdam<SEP>After World War II, Waldenburg became part of Poland under border changes demanded by the Soviet Union at <ENT>Potsdam<ENT> . Many of the Germans living in the city fled or were forcibly expelled, and the city was renamed Wałbrzych. Wałbrzych was one of the few areas where a number of Germans were held back as they were deemed indispensable for the economy, e.g. coal mining. An ethnic German society has been maintained in Walbrzych since 1957.
Glastonbury<SEP>In April and May 1994 the band first performed songs from The Holy Bible at concerts in Thailand and Portugal and at a benefit concert for the Anti-Nazi League at Brockwell Park, London. In June, they played <ENT>Glastonbury<ENT> . In July and August, without Richey Edwards, they played T in the Park in Scotland, the Alte Wartesaal in Cologne, the Parkpop Festival in The Hague and the Reading Festival. During September, October and December there was a headline tour of the UK and Ireland and two tours in mainland Europe with Suede and Therapy?. In December, three nights at the London Astoria ended with the band smashing up their equipment and the venue's lighting rig, causing £26,000 worth of damage.
Aughrim<SEP>His precipitate withdrawal with the cavalry of the left flank at <ENT>Aughrim<ENT> gave rise to suspicions of disloyalty.

Haitian<SEP>In a document that is dated 1807, a grammatical description of the language is included in the experiences of an enslaved woman named Robin. This was prior to arrival in Louisiana of French-speaking colonists and African slaves from Saint-Domingue; the whites and free people of color (also French speaking), were refugees from <ENT>Haitian<ENT> , that had established the second republic in the western hemisphere. The statements collected from Robin showed linguistic features that are now known to be typical of Louisiana Creole.

Indianapolis<SEP>Rick Ravon Mears (born December 3, 1951 in Wichita, Kansas), also known by the nickname "Rocket Rick", is a retired American race car driver. He is one of three men to win <ENT>Indianapolis<ENT> four times (1979, 1984, 1988, 1991), and is the current record-holder for pole positions in the race with six (1979, 1982, 1986, 1988, 1989, 1991). Mears is also a three-time Indycar series/World Series champion (1979, 1981 and 1982).
Daytona<SEP>Marsh drove a Ferrari 430 in <ENT>Daytona<ENT> in 2008. He shared car number 56 with 2007 FIA GT champion Thomas Biagi, Christian Montanari from Italy and Spaniard Luis Monzon. The car was run by the Italian Mastercar team. Montanari put the car on the front row of the class grid [3] but the team retired after 61 laps.
Selma<SEP>In August 1963, 22-year old folksinger Joan Baez, led a crowd of 300,000 in singing "We Shall Overcome" at the Lincoln Memorial during A. Philip Randolph's March on Washington. President Lyndon Johnson, himself a Southerner, used the phrase "we shall overcome" in addressing Congress on March 15, 1965, in a speech delivered after the violent "Bloody Sunday" attacks on civil rights demonstrators during <ENT>Selma<ENT> , thus legitimizing the protest movement.
Aughrim<SEP>At the start of the war, Irish Jacobites controlled most of Ireland for James II, with the exception of the Williamite strongholds at Derry and at Enniskillen in Ulster. The Jacobites besieged Derry from December 1688 to July 1689, ending when a Williamite army from Britain relieved the city. The Williamites based in Enniskillen defeated another Jacobite army at the battle of Newtownbutler on 28 July 1689. Thereafter, Ulster remained firmly under Williamite control and William's forces completed their conquest of the rest of Ireland in the next two years. The war provided Protestant loyalists with the iconic victories of the Siege of Derry, the Battle of the Boyne (1 July 1690) and <ENT>Aughrim<ENT> (12 July 1691), all of which the Orange Order commemorate each year.
Nürnberg<SEP>At the end of the war, Zeitzler was captured by British troops. He was a prisoner of war until the end of February 1947. He appeared as a witness for the defense during <ENT>Nürnberg<ENT> , and  worked with the Operational History Section (German) of the Historical Division of the U.S. Army.
Gettysburg<SEP>Ray, an authority on military uniforms of the Revolutionary War and a consultant to the Smithsonian Institution, also wrote books on American history, including Oh, Say, Can You See (1970), and Alfred R. Waud, Civil War Artist (1974), and additionally wrote, illustrated and published historical booklets on Fort McHenry and "The Star Spangled Banner"; Fort Niagara; Fort Ticonderoga; the Alamo; Antietam; <ENT>Gettysburg<ENT> , and other topics. He drew covers and interior art for magazines including Civil War Times Illustrated, American History Illustrated, where he served as Art Director for Historical Times, Inc., and for True Frontier, The West and Yank, and designed historical medals and figurines for the Danbury Mint. He was living in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, at the time of his death at age 80.
Indianapolis<SEP>Some major races, such as the Singapore Grand Prix, Monaco Grand Prix (sanctioned by Formula One) and the Long Beach Grand Prix (sanctioned by IndyCar), are held on temporary street circuits. However, most open-wheel races are on dedicated road courses, such as Watkins Glen International in the US, Nürburgring in Germany, Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium and Silverstone in Great Britain. In the United States some top-level open-wheel events are held on ovals, of both short track and superspeedway variety, with an emphasis being placed more on speed and endurance than the maneuverability inherently required by road and street course events. The Whelen Modified Tour is the only opened wheeled race car series endorsed by NASCAR. This series races on most of NASCAR's most famous tracks in the United States. Other asphalt modified series race on short tracks in the United States and Canada, such as Wyoming County International Speedway in New York. The most well-attended oval race in the world is the <ENT>Indianapolis<ENT> (Indy 500) in Speedway, Indiana, sanctioned by IndyCar; in the United States, it is quite common to refer to open-wheel cars as IndyCars, or Champ Cars, because of their recognizable appearance and widespread popularity across America at the Indy 500.
Covent Garden<SEP>The area was formerly mainly industrial but is now becoming more residential and commercial in character. It is dominated by Battersea Power Station, various railway lines and <ENT>Covent Garden<ENT> . Also in the area is the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home.
Daytona<SEP>Moran also teamed with P. J. Jones and Mark Dismore to win the 1993 <ENT>Daytona<ENT> event.
Olympian<SEP>Diving is the sport of jumping or falling into water from a platform or springboard, usually while performing acrobatics. Diving is an internationally recognized sport that is part of <ENT>Olympian<ENT> .  In addition, unstructured and non-competitive diving is a recreational pastime.
Boston<SEP>The American Revolutionary War erupted with the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775. Benedict Arnold was a militia leader from Connecticut who had arrived with his unit in support of <ENT>Boston<ENT> ; he proposed to the Massachusetts Committee of Safety that Fort Ticonderoga on Lake Champlain in the Province of New York be captured from its small British garrison.  One reason that he gave to justify the move was the presence of heavy weaponry at Ticonderoga.  On May 3, the committee gave Arnold a Massachusetts colonel's commission and authorized the operation.
Kronstad<SEP>Born on 25 July 1899 in the village of Pokhorovka in Nizhny Novgorod Governorate, Galanin was drafted into the Red Army in April 1919. He was initially sent to the Simbirsk Reserve Regiment as an ordinary soldier.  Galanin fought on the Eastern Front with the 296th Rifle Regiment, and from December served with the 2nd Brigade of the 25th Rifle Division. He joined the Communist Party in 1920. In April 1920, he transferred to the 38th VOKhR Battalion of the Urals Cheka. In June, Galanin was sent to study at the 2nd Moscow Infantry Courses. He led a cadet section in the suppression of <ENT>Kronstad<ENT> in March 1921.
Stalingrad<SEP>After <ENT>Stalingrad<ENT> , which ended with the destruction of the entire German 6th Army in February 1943, many had started to doubt the inevitability of an Axis victory, and most French gendarmes were not willing to hunt the down the maquis, knowing that they might be tried for their actions if the Allies won. Only the men of the Groupe mobile de réserve paramilitary police were considered reliable, but the force was too small to hunt down thousands of men. As the Germans preferred to subcontract the work of ruling France to the French while retaining ultimate control, it was the Milice that was given the task of destroying the maquis. The Milice was in Ousby's words "Vichy's only instrument for fighting the Maquis. Entering the popular vocabulary at more or less the same time, the words maquis and milice together defined the new realities: the one a little-known word for the back country of Corsica, which became a synonym for militant resistance; the other a familiar word meaning simply "militia", which became a synonym for militant repression. The Maquis and the Milice were enemies thrown up by the final chaos of the Occupation, in a sense twins symbiotically linked in a final hunt."
Kosovo<SEP>In 1999, Sino-US relations took another ugly downturn when NATO forces undergoing bombing operations in Yugoslavia during <ENT>Kosovo<ENT> bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. Three Chinese journalists died in the bombing, and Beijing reacted harshly. Mass anti-US protests rocked the streets of Beijing in the largest public demonstrations to take place since the pro-democracy movement 10 years earlier. Despite US statements that the bombing was accidental, China did not accept this explanation, bitterly condemning the action and demanding a full apology. In an official statement, then-Vice-President Hu Jintao declared the action as "barbaric" and behind the basic principle of ignorant "American hegemony". In the same statement he raised traditional slogans regarding the strength of the Chinese people, to rally behind the government and Jiang's leadership a huge portion of the populace. As protests escalated, the Central Government began changing its tone in an attempt to calm the outpouring wave of nationalism.
Lyme<SEP>Infectious diseases causing ILI include malaria, acute HIV/AIDS infection, herpes, hepatitis C, <ENT>Lyme<ENT> , rabies, myocarditis, Q fever, dengue fever, poliomyelitis, pneumonia, measles, and many others.
Irish Republic<SEP>The nationalist leader John Redmond pledged support for the British war effort and many Irishmen served in the British Army (see Ireland and World War I), but the war and the frustration of nationalist ambitions regarding Home Rule led to a radicalisation of Irish nationalism. In 1916, a group of IRB activists within the Irish Volunteers led an insurrection aimed at Irish independence in Dublin, known as <ENT>Irish Republic<ENT> . The rebellion did not have popular support and was put down within a week, but the execution of its leaders, and the subsequent wholesale arrest of radical nationalist activists proved very unpopular with the nationalist public. Coming directly after the Rising, a further attempt was made at the Irish Convention to resolve the impasse over Home Rule, but without success. Finally, the British proposal to extend conscription for the war to Ireland provoked widespread resistance, (see Conscription Crisis of 1918) and discredited the Irish Parliamentary Party who had supported the British war effort.
Monterey<SEP>John Lewis of the Modern Jazz Quartet invited Ponty to perform at <ENT>Monterey<ENT> in 1967, which led to a recording contract with the World Pacific and the albums Electric Connection (1969) with the Gerald Wilson Big Band and Jean-Luc Ponty Experience with the George Duke Trio (1969). That year also brought Sunday Walk (1967), the first collaboration between Ponty and Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen.
Hastings<SEP>The first Norman castle on Castle Rock was a wooden structure of a motte-and-bailey design, begun in 1068, two years after <ENT>Hastings<ENT> , on the orders of William the Conqueror. This wooden structure was replaced by a far more defensible stone castle during the reign of King Henry II, of an imposing and complex architectural design, which eventually comprised an upper bailey at the highest point of the castle rock, a middle bailey to the north containing the main royal apartments, and a large outer bailey to the east.
Glastonbury<SEP>In 2011 The Master Musicians of Joujouka headlined <ENT>Glastonbury<ENT> playing the Pyramid Stage on 24 June along with Metronomy, Wu Tang Clan, B.B. King, and U2.
Roswell<SEP>The popularization of the idea of the Grey alien is commonly associated with the Barney and Betty Hill abduction claim, which purportedly took place in New Hampshire in 1961, although skeptics see precursors in science fiction and earlier paranormal claims; Grey aliens are also famed from earlier depictions of the <ENT>Roswell<ENT> . Some sources in the UFO community describe the Grey aliens as an artificially created/modified race used by other alien races as servants or even slaves to execute tasks such as abductions and others. Whatever the origin, the Grey alien has since emerged as an archetypal image of sentient non-human creatures and extraterrestrial life in general, as well as an iconic trope of popular culture in the age of space exploration.
Wuchang<SEP>In 1911, after <ENT>Wuchang<ENT> and Xinhai Revolution, Chen's forces occupied Shanghai. He was then made military governor of the region. He fled to Japan with Sun Yat-sen upon the failure of the revolution against Yuan Shikai's dictatorship.  They subsequently formed the Chinese Revolutionary Party, which later became the Kuomintang, or the Chinese Nationalist Party.
Cheltenham<SEP>In March 1991, Granville Again made his first appearance at <ENT>Cheltenham<ENT> and started the 2/1 favourite in a field of twenty-one for the Supreme Novices' Hurdle. He was hampered twice during the race, and although he finished strongly, he was unable to catch the Irish-trained Destriero and finished second, beaten four lengths by the winner and three quarters of a length ahead of Gran Alba. On 5 April, Granville Again started the 5/4 favourite for the Grade II Top Novices' Hurdle at the Grand National meeting at Aintree Racecourse. He was restrained by Scudamore in the early stages before moving into contention at half way. He took the lead jumping the final hurdle and won by one and a half lengths from Gran Alba with Young Pokey (later to win the Arkle Challenge Trophy) in third place.
LM<SEP>In 1996 he raced briefly in the Renault Spider Eurocup, and he campaigned a Renault Laguna touring car for the Williams team in the British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) in 1999, acquiring the nickname 'JCB' from commentator Charlie Cox. In 2000 he turned to sports car racing with some success, and has raced several times in <ENT>LM<ENT> . He earned a third place in the 2007 24 Hours of Le Mans, along with Emmanuel Collard and Romain Dumas a Pescarolo Sport entry.
Kosovo<SEP>Educated at Stowe School in Buckinghamshire and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, Burnell-Nugent joined the Royal Navy in 1971. He was given command of the diesel submarine HMS Olympus in 1978 and of the nuclear-powered submarine HMS Conqueror in 1984, carrying out many Cold War patrols. He became Commanding Officer of the frigate HMS Brilliant as well as Captain of the 2nd Frigate Squadron in 1992, and in that capacity was involved in the early stages of the Bosnia Crisis. He was in command of the aircraft carrier HMS Invincible and made two joint operational deployments to the Gulf for air operations over Iraq and then conducted further air operations during <ENT>Kosovo<ENT> . He became Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff in 1999. As Commander United Kingdom Maritime Forces from 2001 to 2002, he was Maritime Commander of the UK Joint Force and the Deputy Maritime Commander of the Coalition for the first 6 months of the War in Afghanistan.
Stalingrad<SEP>Red Army soldiers in <ENT>Stalingrad<ENT> in snow camouflage overalls, January 1943
Kent<SEP>The ETSU campus experienced relatively little in terms of student protest during the late 1960s and early 1970s, although the dress of students changed radically as the previous strict dress codes fell by the wayside in favor of miniskirts, ragged jeans, and shorts. Controlled substances such as marijuana and LSD were somewhat popular among the student body, albeit not to the same degree as on many other college campuses. Protests against the Vietnam War were rare and sparsely attended; however, in 1970 a tense disagreement between students regarding whether or not to lower the American flag on campus to half-mast in memory of those killed in <ENT>Kent<ENT> resulted in a compromise in which a makeshift flagpole was erected by a group of liberal students so they could fly the flag at half-staff while a group of conservative students kept the flag on the main pole flying at full-staff.
San Remo<SEP>Silly's first notable concert appearances outside East Germany were in Romania, where the band gained a strong following; it helped that Fritzsching and Danz could speak Romanian fluently. They participated in several music festivals, and in 1981 won the Lyra in Bratislava, the communist bloc's best-known music prize (akin to <ENT>San Remo<ENT> ). The band was also allowed to perform in Norway.
Iwo Jima<SEP>Portland served in many engagements including the Battle of Coral Sea, the Battle of Midway and the Guadalcanal Campaign, where she was severely damaged but nonetheless able to return to service. She later fought in the Battle of Leyte Gulf and the Battle of Okinawa. Indianapolis served as a fleet flagship for much of the war and fought in the Battle of Philippine Sea and <ENT>Iwo Jima<ENT> . On 30 July 1945, after transporting components for the nuclear weapons Little Boy and Fat Man from the United States, she was torpedoed by the Japanese submarine I-58. Due to a series of errors and miscommunications her loss was not discovered for several days, and only 316 of her 1,195 crew survived – the greatest single loss of life at sea, from a single ship, in the history of the U.S. Navy.
Kosovo<SEP>Eighteen days after the breakup, the Japan-only release The Greatest was released. The song "Waterline" was included on the 1999 charity record Grænseløs Greatest in support of refugees of <ENT>Kosovo<ENT> . In 2000, the Danish dance-pop duo Infernal used samples of the 1994 song "Silverflame" for the song "Sunrise". It was released as the second single from their album Waiting for Daylight.
Haitian<SEP>Thompson and Hobsbawm were Marxists who were critical of the existing labour movement in Britain. They were concerned to approach history "from below" and to explore the agency and activity of working people at the workplace, in protest movements and in social and cultural activities. Thompson's seminal study The Making of the English Working Class was particularly influential in setting a new agenda for labor historians and locating the importance of the study of labor for social history in general. Also in the 1950s and 1960s, historians began to give serious attention to groups who had previously been largely neglected, such as women and non-caucasian ethnic groups. Some historians situated their studies of gender and race within a class analysis: for example, C. L. R. James, a Marxist who wrote about the struggles of blacks in <ENT>Haitian<ENT> . Others questioned whether class was a more important social category than gender or race and pointed to racism, patriarchy and other examples of division and oppression within the working class.
Indian Wells<SEP>Tsonga then competed at <ENT>Indian Wells<ENT> , where he reached the fourth round, before losing to defending champion Rafael Nadal in three sets. Following the tournament, Tsonga saw his ATP ranking climb again to a new career high of No. 12.
Olympian<SEP>Competitions, sometimes referred to as dancesport, range from world championships, regulated by the World Dance Council (WDC), to less advanced dancers at various proficiency levels. Most competitions are divided into professional and amateur, though in the USA pro-am competitions typically accompany professional competitions. The International Olympic Committee now recognizes competitive ballroom dance. It has recognized another body, the World DanceSport Federation (WDSF), as the sole representative body for dancesport in <ENT>Olympian<ENT> . However, it seems doubtful that dance will be included in the Olympic Games, especially in light of efforts to reduce the number of participating sports.
Indianapolis<SEP>CART was founded in 1979 by United States Auto Club Championship Division team owners who disagreed with the direction and leadership of USAC, with the then-novel idea of car owners sanctioning and promoting their own series collectively instead of relying on a neutral body to do so. Through the 1980s, the Indy Car World Series became the pre-eminent open-wheel auto racing series in North America, featuring street circuits, road courses, and oval track racing. CART drivers continued to compete at the USAC- <ENT>Indianapolis<ENT> .
Indianapolis<SEP>After his release from Cooper, Gregory also went back to competing in sports car races, setting the overall fastest lap at the 1960 24 Hours of Le Mans. He won the 1961 1000 km Nürburgring, driving alongside Lloyd "Lucky" Casner in a Maserati Tipo 61 for the America Camoradi Racing Team. In the same year, Gregory finished 5th in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in a Porsche RS61 Spyder. 1962 saw Gregory win the Canadian Grand Prix sports car race at Mosport Park in a Lotus 19-Climax. In 1964, Gregory again competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, this time in a Ford GT40. He retired from the race in the 5th hour due to gearbox difficulties. The following year, Gregory teamed up with the man who was to become 1970 Formula One World Champion, Austrian Jochen Rindt, and the pair won the race in a North American Racing Team Ferrari 250 LM. 1965 was also the year in which Gregory raced in <ENT>Indianapolis<ENT> , starting from the back of the grid and working his way up to 5th before being forced to retire due to an engine problem.
Tarawa<SEP>From late November 1943, VF-16 deployed on USS Lexington and supported the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign including <ENT>Tarawa<ENT> . On 23 November VF-16's pilots shot down 17 Japanese aircraft. By the end of 1943 the pilots of VF-16 had shot down 55 Japanese aircraft, with three pilots becoming aces.
Glastonbury<SEP>They toured again in 2015, playing some shows without Larry Gott, who was taking a break from touring: Adrian Oxaal re-joined the band for the duration of the tour, subsequently replacing Gott in the active lineup. Keyboard technician Ron Yeadon, formerly of Unkle Bob, also appeared on stage, singing backing vocals; he later joined the band as a backing vocalist. In 2016, the album Girl at the End of the World was released, with an accompanying tour – building up to the band's planned appearance opening 2016's <ENT>Glastonbury<ENT> (the Other Stage) and later taking a top spot at the On Blackheath festival in September.
Kent<SEP>Collins took over at a very difficult time. The Vietnam War was going badly, and the invasion of Cambodia and <ENT>Kent<ENT> had triggered a wave of protests and unrest across the country. He had no illusions about his ability to change minds, but attempted to engage with the public all the same, playing on his Apollo 11 fame. He attributed part of the nation's problems to insularity. In a 1970 commencement speech at Saint Michael's College in Vermont, he told his audience that "Farmers speak to farmers, students to students, business leaders to other business leaders, but this intramural talk serves mainly to mirror one's beliefs, to reinforce existing prejudices, to lock out opposing views".
Nürnberg<SEP>The Blomberg–Fritsch affair began soon after the marriage on 12 January 1938 of the War Minister Werner von Blomberg to Erna Gruhn, when the Berlin police discovered she had a long criminal record and had posed for pornographic photographs. According to testimony given much later, at <ENT>Nürnberg<ENT> , information received by the Police Commissioner within days also indicated that 'Marshal von Blomberg's wife had been a previously convicted prostitute who had been registered as a prostitute in the files of seven large German cities; she was in the Berlin criminal files.... She had also been sentenced by the Berlin courts for distributing indecent pictures'.
Irish Republic<SEP>Shaw had long supported the principle of Irish Home Rule within the British Empire (which he thought should become the British Commonwealth). In April 1916 he wrote scathingly in The New York Times about militant Irish nationalism: "In point of learning nothing and forgetting nothing these fellow-patriots of mine leave the Bourbons nowhere." Total independence, he asserted, was impractical; alliance with a bigger power (preferably England) was essential. The <ENT>Irish Republic<ENT> later that month took him by surprise. After its suppression by British forces, he expressed horror at the summary execution of the rebel leaders, but continued to believe in some form of Anglo-Irish union. In How to Settle the Irish Question (1917), he envisaged a federal arrangement, with national and imperial parliaments. Holroyd records that by this time the separatist party Sinn Féin was in the ascendency, and Shaw's and other moderate schemes were forgotten.
Sebring<SEP>One special Superformance Shelby Daytona Coupe was painted Portofino Blue and given white roundels and number ten racing numbers to make it visually similar to the car that won the GT class at <ENT>Sebring<ENT> 1964.  This so-called "tribute" car sold for $270,000, at Barrett-Jackson's autumn 2006 auction, though much controversy continues in the enthusiast community as to whether this price was representative of the state of the market in such cars.
Olympian<SEP>Charles Pierre de Frédy, Baron de Coubertin (French: [pjɛʁ də kubɛʁtɛ̃]; born Pierre de Frédy; 1 January 1863 – 2 September 1937, also known as Pierre de Coubertin and Baron de Coubertin) was a French educator and historian, founder of the International Olympic Committee, and its second President. He is known as the father of the <ENT>Olympian<ENT> .
Isle of Wight<SEP>After the disappointment of not being allowed to carry on her art education Pauline was penniless and had to turn to her enterprising abilities.  She collected old scraps of leather and created Handmade by Pauline Forster in 1969, a clothing and accessory label.  She took her hippy-style products from Kings Road to <ENT>Isle of Wight<ENT> and always sold out.  The business grew over time and her products were stocked by Harrods and were included in the Queen's Christmas crackers as prizes for many years.  Pauline sold Handmade by Pauline Forster in 1994.
Daytona<SEP>Eddie Bierschwale (born June 29, 1959) is a former NASCAR Winston Cup driver from San Antonio, Texas. He made his Cup debut in 1983 in a car owned by his father Don. In 1985 he got a full-season ride with D.K. Ulrich and stayed with the team until the end of the 1986 season when he was let go. After bouncing from team to team in 1987 he returned to his father's team in 1988 and participated in a partial schedule with them until he retired from racing in 1992. His best Cup finish was a 10th in the 1989 <ENT>Daytona<ENT> (he started the car, but jumped out of the car in favor of Kyle Petty, who had failed to qualify for the race in his No. 42). Bierschwale often raced in the No. 23.
Kurukshetra<SEP>During the time of <ENT>Kurukshetra<ENT> , and the reign of Pandavas and Kauravas, we find mention of numerous kingdoms with the name, Kosala (as per the references in Mahabharata).
Dinosaur<SEP>Untermann was also a painter of great accomplishment, specializing in landscapes and prehistoric flora and fauna. He was known as "The Artist of the Uintas." He contributed paintings, murals, and panels to <ENT>Dinosaur<ENT> , the old Utah Field House of Natural History State Park Museum and has a large collection of paintings at the new Utah Field House of Natural History State Park Museum in Vernal, Utah.  His interest in paleontology and Geology led to his moving to Vernal, Utah.
Gettysburg<SEP>Eduardo Newbery was of American descent. His father Ralph Lamartine Newbery, emigrated from Long Island, New York, and settled in Argentina after the American Civil War (in which, supposedly, he took part at <ENT>Gettysburg<ENT> ). Eduardo was one of aviation pioneer Jorge Newbery's siblings (the others were Ernesto Purcell, Elena Rosa, Rodolfo León and María de los Dolores (twins), Elvira Teresa, Emma Catalina, Carlos Alfredo, Luis Alfredo, Juan Alberto Martín and Ana Eva).
Lyme<SEP>Complications include acute respiratory failure, congestive heart failure, and renal failure. Infections can be fatal in 5–10% of hospitalized patients, with increased risk of death in the immunosuppressed, the elderly, and those coinfected with <ENT>Lyme<ENT> . B. divergens infections have a much higher fatality rate (42%) and present with more severe symptoms. Infected individuals suffer from hemoglobinuria followed by jaundice, a persistently high fever, chills, and sweats. If left untreated, B. divergens infections can develop into shock-like symptoms with pulmonary edema and renal failure.
Haitian<SEP>From 1801 he was the leader of Legia Naddunajska. He was sent on his own request to Haiti in May 1802 (before the decision to send the rest of the Polish legions). There he worked to put down <ENT>Haitian<ENT> . Jabłonowski died from yellow fever on 29 September 1802 in Jérémie, Haiti.
Potsdam<SEP>Following World War II, Britain retained control of both British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland as protectorates. In 1945, during <ENT>Potsdam<ENT> , the United Nations granted Italy trusteeship of Italian Somaliland as the Trust Territory of Somaliland, on the condition—first proposed by the Somali Youth League (SYL) and other nascent Somali political organizations, such as Hizbia Digil Mirifle Somali (HDMS) and the Somali National League (SNL)—that Somalia achieve independence within ten years. British Somaliland remained a protectorate of Britain until 1960.
Hastings<SEP>In 1066, after the death of King Edward the Confessor, Yorkshire became the stage for two major battles that would help decide who would succeed to the throne.  Harold Godwinson was declared King by the English but this was disputed by Harold Hardrada King of Norway and William Duke of Normandy.  In the late summer of 1066 Harold Hardrada, accompanied by Tostig Godwinson, took a large Norwegian fleet and army up the Humber towards York.  They were met by the army of the northern earls Edwin of Mercia and Morcar of Northumbria who they defeated at the Battle of Fulford.  Harold Hardrada occupied York and the Norwegian Army encamped at Stamford Bridge.  Harold Godwinson had to travel from London gathering his army as he went to face the invasion.  Within five days, on 25 September 1066, Harold Godwinson had reached Stamford Bridge and defeated the Norwegian Army in a battle in which both Harold Hardrada and Tostig Godwinson were killed.  The battle at Stamford Bridge can be seen as one of the pivotal battles in English history, it was the last time a Scandinavian army was able to seriously threaten England.  On 28 September William Duke of Normandy landed on the south coast of England forcing Harold Godwinson to rush south from Yorkshire with his army. They met at <ENT>Hastings<ENT> where the English army was defeated and Harold Godwinson killed, allowing William to become King of England.
Indy<SEP>In 1925, the first permanent autodrome in France was built, it was called Autodrome de Linas-Montlhéry, located 20 miles south of the centre of the French capital of Paris. The 7.7‑mile (12.3 km) circuit included a 51‑degree concrete banking, an asphalt road course and then-modern facilities, including pit garages and grandstands. After the construction of Brooklands in England in 1907, and Indianapolis in the United States in 1908 and after World War I, Monza in Italy was opened in 1922, and Stiges–Terramar in Spain was also opened in 1923. The French were then prompted to construct a purpose-built racing circuit at Montlhéry in the north and then Miramas in the south. Nürburgring in Germany followed in 1927. Montlhery first held the Grand Prix de l'ACF in 1925 as part of the inaugural World Manufacturers' Championship, the first time Grands Prix were grouped together to form a championship. The circuit drew huge crowds and they were witnesses to the spectacular sight of fast cars racing on Montlhéry's steep banking and asphalt road course, which had many fast corners and long straights, and was located in a forest. The first race at Montlhéry was marred by the fatal accident of Antonio Ascari in an Alfa P2. Miramas, a high-banked concrete oval track like Brooklands and part of Montlhéry was completed in 1926, and it played host to the Grand Prix that year. This race saw only three cars compete, all Bugattis, and was won by Frenchman Jules Goux who had also won <ENT>Indy<ENT> in 1913.
Lyme<SEP>Clinical areas include HIV, <ENT>Lyme<ENT> , Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), avian influenza, West Nile virus, Malaria, Nipah virus, and other emerging infectious diseases.
San Remo<SEP>In 1952 Ernesto Bonino moved to the United States and realized his dream of singing jazz standards in the best clubs of New York City, Chicago and Miami. He made a brief comeback to Italy in 1955 for the Garinei and Giovannini musical comedy La Granduchessa e i camerieri (The Grand Duchess and the Valets). When the run was finished, he returned to the U.S. and remained until 1958. His sole participation in the <ENT>San Remo<ENT> came in 1962, when he placed third with Gondolì, Gondolà, written by the duo Carosone-Nisa. After the contest, Carosone hired him for the European tour of his band.
Taiping<SEP>Since their early ancient trade connection and subsequent migrations, the majority of ethnic Chinese in Malaysia are mostly from ethnic Han from the historical areas of Fujian and Guangdong provinces in southern China. Nearly all ethnic Chinese Malaysians living in the country today are either patrilineal descendants of these early immigrants, or new immigrants born in mainland China. Among the first group from the first migration wave are the Peranakans in Kelantan and Terengganu, Sino-Natives in Sabah and Straits-born Chinese (Baba-Nyonya) in Malacca and Penang. <ENT>Taiping<ENT> in the mid-19th century caused much chaos and suffering in southern China, which leading many ethnic Chinese civilians to sought refuge overseas, particularly to Nanyang region in further south. With the expanding British colonial economies in the region which led to the establishment of Straits Settlements, more migrants were attracted and primary become the important destination for Chinese emigration.
Glastonbury<SEP>The Who toured in support of Endless Wire, including the BBC Electric Proms at the Roundhouse in London in 2006, headlining the <ENT>Glastonbury<ENT> , a half-time appearance at the Super Bowl XLIV in 2010 and being the final act at the closing ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.  In November 2012, the Who released Live at Hull, an album of the band's performance night after the Live at Leeds gig.
Lyme<SEP>In July 2015, while Jimmy Fallon was recovering from surgery after suffering a serious injury to his finger, Higgins was hospitalized for <ENT>Lyme<ENT> . He returned to the Tonight Show fully recovered and on the same night as Fallon's return.
Kosovo<SEP>The Netherlands abandoned its neutrality in 1948 when it signed the Treaty of Brussels, and became a founding member of NATO in 1949. The Dutch military was therefore part of the NATO strength in Cold War Europe, deploying its army to several bases in Germany. More than 3,000 Dutch soldiers were assigned to the 2nd Infantry Division of the United States Army during the Korean War. In 1996 conscription was suspended, and the Dutch army was once again transformed into a professional army. Since the 1990s the Dutch army has been involved in the Bosnian War and <ENT>Kosovo<ENT> , it held a province in Iraq after the defeat of Saddam Hussein, and it was engaged in Afghanistan.
Battle of Kortrijk<SEP>The Flemish Movement became more socially oriented through the Frontbeweging (Front Movement), an organization of Flemish soldiers who complained about the lack of consideration for their language in the army, and in Belgium in general, and harbored pacifistic feelings. The Frontbeweging became a political movement, dedicated to peace, tolerance and autonomy (Nooit Meer Oorlog, Godsvrede, Zelfbestuur). A yearly pilgrimage to the IJzertoren is still held to this day. The poet Anton van Wilderode wrote many texts for this occasion. Many rumours arose regarding the treatment of Flemish soldiers in World War I, though Flemish historians debunked many of these. One such rumour is that many Dutch-speaking soldiers were slaughtered because they could not understand orders given to them in French by French speaking officers. Whether a disproportionate number of Flemish died in the war compared to Walloons, is to this day being disputed. It is clear however, that the Belgian army de facto had only French as the official language. The phrase "et pour les Flamands, la meme chose" originated in this environment also, allegedly being used by the French-speaking officers to "translate" their orders into Dutch. It literally means "and for the Flemish, the same thing", which adds insult to injury for Flemish soldiers not understanding French. Another source of further frustration was the Belgian royal family's poor knowledge of Dutch. King Albert I enjoyed some popularity in the early ages of the war, because he was a proponent of the bilingual status of Flanders – even though Wallonia was monolingual French, because he declared his oath to be king in both French and Dutch, and because he gave a speech at the start of the war in Dutch, referring to <ENT>Battle of Kortrijk<ENT> . In the last years of the war however, it became clear that the only wish of the king was to keep his country peaceful, and not to give the Flemish the rights the French-speaking establishment denied them.
Boston<SEP>On the morning of 14 December 1774, John Langdon made his way through Portsmouth with a drummer, collecting a crowd to descend on the fort. Several hundred men responded to his call, setting out for The Castle by way of the Piscataqua River. The colonists removed 100 barrels of gun powder, light cannons, and small arms. These captured supplies were later used by New Hampshire's forces against the British military, including at <ENT>Boston<ENT> .
Potsdam<SEP>After the war, the town was transferred to Poland under border changes promulgated at <ENT>Potsdam<ENT> . Its surviving German residents who had not evacuated were subsequently expelled westward and replaced with Poles, most of whom were themselves expelled from the pre-war Polish Vilnius Region that was annexed by the Soviet Union and given to the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic. The town was given the historic Polish name Rastembork in 1945, and in 1946 it was renamed to Kętrzyn after the Polish historian Wojciech Kętrzyński. Both names are still commonly used nowadays, with Rastembork being more popular among ethnic Masurians and foreigners.
Isle of Wight<SEP>Inspired by his experiences during the "liberation" of <ENT>Isle of Wight<ENT> 1970, in which the  fences between the paid event and free gathering outside were torn down, Dwyer developed the idea of a truly "free" festival. An acid trip in Windsor Great Park led to the notion of squatting on the former common land that had been in Crown ownership since being reserved for royal hunting by William the Conqueror, and he began to organise what was to become the People's Free Festival. Windsor Free Festival was the forerunner of, and inspiration for, the Free Festival Movement, particularly the Stonehenge Free Festival and the later Glastonbury Festivals. Following the violent suppression of the 1974 event, he and Sid Rawle were imprisoned to prevent the organising of a 1975 festival. Dwyer was imprisoned again attempting to organise another Windsor Free Festival in 1978, which did take place at Caesar's Camp nearby.
Karameh<SEP>This Division was involved in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, reprisal operations, the Six-Day War, <ENT>Karameh<ENT> , the War of Attrition, Black September and the Yom Kippur War.
Daytona<SEP>2001 saw Björk race in several different series; concentrating on the FIA Sportscar Championship SR2 class for Sportscar Racing Team Sweden, taking the title together with American Larry Oberto. Björk finished third in the Swedish GT series, and was on the podium in 11 out of 12 races, and he also made his debut in STCC, filling in for Kristoffersson Motorsport's Roberto Colciago for one weekend. There he showed pace from the start, finishing second in one of the weekend's two races. He also raced in <ENT>Daytona<ENT> , taking the class pole position and fastest lap but had to retire after gearbox failure while in the lead.
Wakefield<SEP>The region took no active part in the ensuing civil wars until the Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471, but both parties to the feud were killed in the civil wars over the next few years. The new Earl of Devon, who had killed Radford, was a thorough supporter of the Lancastrian regime. After the Yorkist victory at the Battle of Northampton in June 1460, he took his troops northwards to Margaret of Anjou in York, where, in April 1461, he was executed by the new king, Edward IV after the Battle of Towton. Bonville's son and grandson had been killed with the Duke of York and the Earl of Salisbury at <ENT>Wakefield<ENT> in December 1460, and Bonville himself, captured after the Second Battle of St Albans was summarily beheaded – probably, so the chroniclers tell us, after a mock trial directly instigated by the Earl of Devon.
Irish independence<SEP>The first meeting of the Dáil coincided with an unauthorised shooting of two RIC men in Tipperary, now regarded as the outbreak of <ENT>Irish independence<ENT> . From 1919 to 1921 the Irish Volunteers (now renamed as the Irish Republican Army, being deemed by the Dáil to be the army of the new Irish Republic) engaged in guerrilla warfare against the British army, the RIC and paramilitary police units known as the Black and Tans and Auxiliaries. The violence started out slowly, with only 19 deaths in 1919, but escalated sharply from the second half of 1920 and in the first six months of 1921 alone there were 1,000 deaths on all sides. The principle political leader of the republican movement was Éamon de Valera – the President of the Republic. However he spent much of the conflict in the United States, raising money and support for the Irish cause. In his absence, two young men, Michael Collins and Richard Mulcahy rose to prominence as the clandestine leaders of the IRA – respectively Director of Intelligence and Chief of Staff of the guerrilla organisation.
Irish independence<SEP>The civil war was waged between two opposing groups, the pro-treaty Provisional Government and the anti-treaty IRA, over <ENT>Irish independence<ENT> . The forces of the Provisional Government (which became the Free State in December 1922) supported the Treaty, while the anti-treaty opposition saw it as a betrayal of the Irish Republic (which had been proclaimed during the Easter Rising). Many of those who fought on both sides in the conflict had been members of the Irish Republican Army (Old IRA) during the War of Independence.
Gettysburg<SEP>When Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany on September 1, most of the cast and crew was in a state of fear of what was going to happen. Laughton lightened the mood by reciting <ENT>Gettysburg<ENT> (that he had recited in Ruggles of Red Gap). Another incident of emotional filming was the filming of the scene where Quasimodo rings the bells in the tower of the cathedral for Esmeralda. Feeling in pain because his native Britain had declared war on Germany, Laughton rang the bells over and over again until he fell down from exhaustion, overwhelming the crew with emotion.
San Remo<SEP>He was arrested in 1970 and again 1984 for possession of drugs; in both cases, Califano was acquitted with the formula "because the fact does not exist". In 1976 Califano got his first and main success as a singer with the song "Tutto il resto è noia", included in his eponymous fourth album, for which the critics paired him to the traditional French chansonniers. During these years he continued his activity as lyricist signing, among others, the <ENT>San Remo<ENT> 1973 winner "Un grande amore e niente più" (performed by Peppino di Capri) and the Mia Martini's classic "Minuetto"; he also composed a whole album for Mina, Amanti di valore. In 1978 he released his best-sold album, Tac.
Iwo Jima<SEP>On the Cape Coral side of the bridge, there is a replica of the statue from the Marine Corps War Memorial in Rosslyn, Virginia (which is just outside Washington, D.C.).  The statue depicts the six U.S Marines raising the American flag at <ENT>Iwo Jima<ENT> .  On the Fort Myers side, there is a small Vietnam War Memorial.
Olympian<SEP>The late 19th century idealist advocacy of peace which led to the creation of the Nobel Peace Prize, the Rhodes Scholarships, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and ultimately the League of Nations, also saw the re-emergence of the ancient Olympic ideal. Led by Pierre de Coubertin, this culminated in the holding in 1896 of the first of the <ENT>Olympian<ENT> .
Potsdam<SEP>After the war, British officers in charge of captured German archives came upon the papers depicting Dzhugashvili’s death at Sachsenhausen. The German records indicated that he was shot after he ran into an electric fence attempting to flee after an argument with the British prisoners, autopsy showed he died from electrocution before he was shot. The British Foreign Office briefly considered presenting these papers to Stalin at <ENT>Potsdam<ENT> as a gesture of condolence. They scrapped the idea because neither the British nor the Americans had informed the Soviets that they had captured key German archives, and sharing those papers with Stalin would have prompted the Soviets to inquire about the source of these records.
Fredericksburg<SEP>At the beginning of the Civil War, Getty was a captain in the 4th U.S. Artillery. In September, 1861, he was appointed lieutenant colonel. He commanded four batteries in Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan's 1862 Peninsula Campaign. Named Chief of Artillery of Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside's IX Corps, he served at the battles of South Mountain and Antietam during the Maryland Campaign. On September 25, 1862, Getty was promoted to the rank of brigadier general of volunteers and assigned to the infantry. During <ENT>Fredericksburg<ENT> in December, he commanded the 3rd Division of IX Corps. In March, 1863, Getty's division was sent to Suffolk, Virginia, where the Federal Army under Maj. Gen. John A. Dix successfully resisted Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's investment of the town, which guarded the southern approaches to Norfolk and Hampton Roads.
Olympian<SEP>The Docklands was high on the government's agenda, however, the government at the time could not afford to initiate the investment for the project so the Docklands project stayed on the drawing board. There was a bid for the <ENT>Olympian<ENT> and another proposal was to turn the Docklands into a technology city known as the Multifunction Polis (MFP).
Irish Republic<SEP>On the 26 July 1914, 900 rifles were landed at Howth by Erskine Childers for the Irish Volunteers. Many were used against the British in <ENT>Irish Republic<ENT> and in the subsequent Anglo-Irish War. Among the members of the Howth branches of the Irish Volunteers and Cumann na mBan who participated in this event were the well-known writers Padraic Colum and Mary Colum. Members of both the Howth Volunteers and Baldoyle section of the Irish Citizen Army participated in the Easter Rising in Dublin city and in Fingal. A strong local branch of Sinn Féin developed in the area and there was considerable local involvement in both the Irish War of Independence and Irish Civil War.
Daytona<SEP>Blount made his debut in the then-Nextel Cup Series during the 2004 season. Driving the No. 37 R&J Racing Dodge, he attempted two races and was able to make the Tropicana 400, but finished 43rd after a mechanical failure. He also made one start in the No. 06 Mobil 1 Dodge for Penske-Jasper Racing at Talladega, however he finished 41st after an engine failure. Blount returned to the series in 2006 with plans to run the full season in the No. 37. After failing to qualify for <ENT>Daytona<ENT> , he was released from the team. Beginning with the Golden Corral 500, he was hired by Front Row Motorsports to drive the No. 92 Dodge, which had previously been driven by Randy LaJoie. In 14 races between the team's No. 34, No. 61 and No. 92 cars, Blount was only able to qualify for two, finishing 42nd at both Martinsville Speedway and Richmond International Raceway.
Cheltenham<SEP>Kauto Star moved to England for the 2004/05 season, and his first start of the season came in a class 3 novice chase race at Newbury, which he won easily by 9 lengths from Foreman, who went on to win the Maghull Novices' Chase the following season. His next start came in a class 3 novices' chase at Exeter. He started the 2/11 favourite in a field of three horses. Kauto Star took the lead after the eighth fence. He fell at the second to last fence when he had a 12 length lead. He was passed by Mistral De La Cour, but Kauto Star's jockey Ruby Walsh then re-mounted without his stirrups and chased the leader. He then hit the last fence, but still rapidly closed in on the finishing straight and lost out to Mistral De La Cour by a short-head. After the race, it was discovered that Kauto Star had sustained a fractured hock in the race, which ruled him out of <ENT>Cheltenham<ENT> and the rest of the season.
Taiping Tianguo<SEP>The Chinese population rose from 2,716 in 1851 to 63,000 by 1871. In the decade 1861–70, 64,301 were recorded as arriving, followed by 123,201 in 1871–80 and 61,711 in 1881–1890. 77% were located in California, with the rest scattered across the West, the South, and New England. Most came from Southern China looking for a better life to escape a high poverty as a result of <ENT>Taiping Tianguo<ENT> .
Daytona<SEP>In 1979 he made his first NASCAR Winston Cup Series start, scoring a fifth-place finish in his first race, at Michigan International Speedway. He ran the majority of the 1980 season for a number of teams, scoring two top-10 finishes; towards the end of the year he was hired by John Rebham to drive for his team; in 1981, driving an Oldsmobile, he was involved in a spectacular accident during the UNO Twin 125 qualifying races for <ENT>Daytona<ENT> . Shortly afterwards Rebham, impatient for results and under pressure from his sponsors, fired Anderson, replacing him with Donnie Allison. Anderson would only run a few additional races in the Winston Cup Series and Budweiser Late Model Sportsman Series before retiring.
Kent<SEP>During 1968 revisions to the United States Army Field Manuals there was a move by the United States Secretary of the Army to eliminate the description of the bayonet as a crowd control weapon; however, senior Army leadership resisted the change. A study conducted that year by the Human Resources Research Organization concluded that the bayonet "is highly valuable as a riot control weapon" with a survey of personnel involved in military peacekeeping operations reporting its most valuable attribute was its psychological effect on a crowd. A compromise was ultimately reached whereby use of the bayonet was permitted in cases of violent mobs but not in routine civil operations. Two years later, in the protests that led to <ENT>Kent<ENT> of 1970, two persons were injured after being bayoneted by soldiers of the Ohio National Guard.
Boston<SEP>The American Revolution was the main source of civil religion. It produced a Moses-like leader (George Washington), prophets (Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine), apostles (John Adams, Benjamin Franklin) and martyrs ( <ENT>Boston<ENT> , Nathan Hale), as well as devils (Benedict Arnold), sacred places (Valley Forge), rituals (raising the Liberty Tree), flags (the Betsy Ross flag), sacred holidays (July 4th) and a holy scripture (The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution).
Aughrim<SEP>After the execution by England of the Stuart King Charles I in 1649, his son Charles II was proclaimed king in Scotland (where he was crowned in 1651) and Ireland; but those two countries were invaded by English forces and annexed to the Commonwealth of England under Oliver Cromwell in 1653.  Thus, Charles II was pretender to the throne of England from 1649 to the restoration of 1660, and exiled/deposed King of Scots and King of Ireland, 1653 to 1660.  He died in 1685 and his brother James II and VII came to the throne. He had converted to Catholicism but this only became a worry when his second wife bore a son who would precede his two Protestant daughters.  James was thus deposed by his elder daughter and his son-in-law (who was also his nephew, son of his sister Mary) during the Glorious Revolution in December 1688, and was formally offered the English and Scottish thrones by their respective parliaments a month later - which was still 1688 in England (where New Year's Day was 25 March until 1752) but was already 1689 in Scotland (which adopted 1 January as New Year's Day in 1600).  James made several attempts to regain the throne before his death in 1701, the most important of which was an effort he made with Irish support - that country having not yet acceded to the succession of William and Mary - which led to the Battle of the Boyne and <ENT>Aughrim<ENT> , and set the stage for the subsequent Jacobite risings (or rebellions). These were a series of uprisings or wars between 1688 and 1746 in which supporters of James, his son ("The Old Pretender") and grandson ("The Young Pretender") attempted to restore his direct male line to the throne.
Lyme<SEP>A recent study in British Columbia of 218 deer mice showed 30% (66) were seropositive for Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of <ENT>Lyme<ENT> .
Navarino<SEP>In 1825, the Sultan again called on Muhammad Ali to suppress a local uprising, this time a nationalist revolution by Greek Christians. He was promised rule over Crete, Cyprus, and the Morea (the modern Peloponnese) for his services. His son, Ibrahim Pasha, won quick victories at the head of a conscript army and controlled nearly the entire Peloponnesian peninsula within 10 months of his arrival in February 1825. The Greeks continued guerrilla operations however, and by September of 1827 public opinion in Russia, Britain, and France forced the great powers to intervene in favour of the Greeks. The joint British-Russian-French fleet destroyed Mehmed Ali’s fleet that October at <ENT>Navarino<ENT> , and Ibrahim’s forces were expelled from the Morea a year later following the arrival of a French expeditionary force and a settlement negotiated by the European powers. Once Ibrahim and his forces returned from Greece, preparations to wrest control of Syria began in earnest.
Hastings<SEP>His later work, the Roman de Rou, was, according to Wace, commissioned by Henry II of England. A large part of the Roman de Rou is devoted to William the Conqueror and the Norman conquest of England. Wace's reference to oral tradition within his own family suggests that his account of the preparations for the Conquest and of <ENT>Hastings<ENT> may have been reliant not only on documentary evidence but also on eyewitness testimony from close relations—though no eyewitnesses would have been still alive when he began work on the text. The Roman de Rou also includes a mention of the appearance of Halley's Comet. The relative lack of popularity of the Roman de Rou may reflect the loss of interest in the history of the Duchy of Normandy following the incorporation of continental Normandy into the kingdom of France in 1204.
Stalingrad<SEP>The Siege of Sarajevo was the siege of the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the longest of a capital city in the history of modern warfare. After being initially besieged by the forces of the Yugoslav People's Army, Sarajevo was besieged by the Army of Republika Srpska from 5 April 1992 to 29 February 1996 (1,425 days) during the Bosnian War. The siege lasted three times longer than <ENT>Stalingrad<ENT> and more than a year longer than the Siege of Leningrad.
Monaco<SEP>After he retired from his professional racing career, he continued to compete in the Paris-Dakar Rally, even competing with daughter Vanina in recent years. He won the event in 1983 driving a Mercedes-Benz G-Class. Nowadays, he appears in historic events as a driver, such as the Goodwood Festival of Speed and the Monterey Historics, usually on behalf of Porsche and Ferrari. He still acts as the Clerk of the Course for <ENT>Monaco<ENT> and is still a resident of Brussels.
Cheltenham<SEP>He won nine of his eighteen races, finishing second in a further four. The majority of his runs were in the hands of Tony McCoy. Wichita Lineman's final win came at the <ENT>Cheltenham<ENT> , where he rallied from 15-20 lengths.
Fredericksburg<SEP>On the organization of the 45th Pennsylvania volunteers, he became its lieutenant-colonel, and first saw active service in the neighborhood of Hilton Head and Port Royal, South Carolina. A new call for volunteers was issued in 1862 and Lieut-Col. Beaver was commissioned colonel of the 148th Pennsylvania volunteers, recruited in the vicinity of his home. He had by this time developed high qualities as a disciplinarian, and his men made it their boast that they were often mistaken for regulars. The regiment joined the army of the Potomac just after <ENT>Fredericksburg<ENT> , was assigned to Hancock's corps, and first met the enemy at the Battle of Chancellorsville (2 and 3 May 1863), where it held an advanced position, and lost very heavily, Col. Beaver being among the wounded.
Indianapolis<SEP>Donohue is probably best known as the driver of the 1500+ bhp "Can-Am Killer" Porsche 917-30 and as the winner of <ENT>Indianapolis<ENT> in 1972. Cars that Donohue raced include: AMC Javelin, AMC Matador, Chevrolet Camaro, Eagle-Offy, Elva Courier, Ford GT40 MK IV, Ferrari 250LM, Ferrari 512, Lola T70, Lola T330, Lotus 20, McLaren M16, Porsche 911, Porsche 917/10, Porsche 917/30, Shelby Cobra, and Shelby Mustang GT350R.
Gettysburg<SEP>Republicanism was based on Ancient Greco-Roman, Renaissance, and English models and ideas. It formed the basis for the American Revolution, the Declaration of Independence (1776), the Constitution (1787), and the Bill of Rights, as well as <ENT>Gettysburg<ENT> (1863).
Navarino<SEP>She was Codrington's flagship at <ENT>Navarino<ENT> .
Monterey<SEP>The fairgrounds is the site of <ENT>Monterey<ENT> as well as First City Festival.
Kent<SEP>In 1969, he became president of the Rochester Institute of Technology which had moved from its old campus in downtown Rochester, New York to a much larger campus on a former farm in the suburb of Henrietta, New York.  Miller inherited a nearly 12% budget deficit, the result of declining enrollment, higher attrition, and higher costs for the new campus which resulted in several years of austerity.  Miller implemented zero-based budgeting, forecasting of student enrollment, and made the dormitories co-ed.  Additionally, Miller quelled student demonstrations in the wake of <ENT>Kent<ENT> and oversaw precautions taken to defend against the flooding of Hurricane Agnes.  Miller attempted to overcome persistent vandalism of the dormitories by staying in them with the students and later instituting a carrot-and-stick repair or improve budget for each dorm.  Miller improved faculty compensation and student representation in the Institute equivalent of the faculty senate. Miller hired RIT's first provost, Todd Bullard, in 1970.
Monterey<SEP>Appearing Nightly is a live album by American composer, bandleader and keyboardist Carla Bley, recorded in Paris in 2006 and released on the Watt/ECM label in 2008. Bley's compositions and arrangements incorporate many references to big bands and jazz standards from the swing era. The album contains two compositions commissioned by the Jazz Orchestra of Sardinia, and a suite inspired by nightclubs and big bands of the 1950s commissioned for <ENT>Monterey<ENT> .
Stalingrad<SEP>However, later confrontations with Soviet troops such as <ENT>Stalingrad<ENT> , where entire enemy units were armed with PPSh-41 submachine guns, the Germans found themselves out-gunned in short range urban combat which caused a shift in their tactics, and by the end of the war the MP 40 and its derivatives were being issued to entire assault platoons on a limited basis. Starting in 1943, the German military moved to replace both the Karabiner 98k rifle and MP 40 with the new, revolutionary StG 44. By the end of World War II in 1945, an estimated 1.1 million MP 40s had been produced of all variants.
Schengen<SEP>Dragoumis also criticised Venizelos for helping pass a law – "in order to boost [his] popularity among Greek republicans" – to impose a requirement on King Constantine II, former king of the Hellenes, and his family if they wanted to be granted Greek nationality. The requirement was to submit a declaration that they "unreservedly respected the 1975 Constitution and accepted and recognised the Hellenic Republic". The columnist termed it a "silly precondition – reminiscent of the 'declarations of repentance' that Greek leftists were obliged to sign under pressure during the civil war and after". Ultimately, the law proved irrelevant once Greece signed <ENT>Schengen<ENT> allowing the ex-king to travel to Greece via Italy without having to pass through Greek immigration.
Indy<SEP>After retiring from Formula One, Piquet tried his hand at <ENT>Indy<ENT> for two years. He also had a go at sports car racing at various points during and after his Formula One career. Piquet is currently retired and runs several businesses in Brazil. He also manages his sons Nelson Piquet Jr. and Pedro Piquet, who are also professional racing drivers.
Black Oak<SEP>Rare Earth was the opening act at California Jam festival in Ontario, California on April 6, 1974. The festival attracted over 250,000 people, and the band appeared alongside 1970s rock groups Black Sabbath; Emerson, Lake & Palmer; Deep Purple; Earth, Wind & Fire; Seals and Crofts; <ENT>Black Oak<ENT> and Eagles. Portions of the show were broadcast on ABC Television in the U.S., exposing the band to a wider audience.
Monterey<SEP>The next year, she met trumpeter Cecil Bridgewater, and after their marriage, they moved to New York City, where Cecil played in Horace Silver's band. In the early 1970s, Bridgewater joined the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra as lead vocalist. This marked the beginning of her jazz career, and she performed with many of the great jazz musicians of the time, such as Sonny Rollins, Dizzy Gillespie, Dexter Gordon, Max Roach, Rahsaan Roland Kirk and others. She performed at <ENT>Monterey<ENT> in 1973. In 1974, her first solo album, entitled Afro Blue, appeared, and she performed on Broadway in the musical The Wiz. For her role as Glinda the Good Witch she won a Tony Award in 1975 as "Best Featured Actress", and the musical also won the 1976 Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album.
Abu Ghraib<SEP>On 2 September 2006, <ENT>Abu Ghraib<ENT> was formally handed over to Iraq's government. The formal transfer was conducted between Major General Jack Gardner, Commander of Task Force 134, and representatives of the Iraqi Ministry of Justice and the Iraqi army.
Nürnberg<SEP>In the case of Norway, the 1940 German invasion of Norway in the <ENT>Nürnberg<ENT> the German defense argued that Germany was "compelled to attack Norway by the need to forestall an Allied invasion and that her action was therefore preemptive." The German defence was referring to Plan R 4 and its predecessors. Norway was vital to Germany as a transport route for iron ore from Sweden, a supply that Britain was determined to stop. One adopted British plan was to go through Norway and occupy cities in Sweden. An Allied invasion was ordered on March 12, and the Germans intercepted radio traffic setting March 14 as deadline for the preparation. Peace in Finland interrupted the Allied plans, but Hitler became, rightly, convinced that the Allies would try again, and ordered operation Weseruebung.
Daytona<SEP>The Strictly Stock series was renamed the Grand National Series. The race is moved to February, which becomes a tradition still held to this day with the <ENT>Daytona<ENT> . Harold Kite won the race in a 1949 Lincoln. He took the lead on lap 25 when Red Byron pitted with gear shift problems. Kite led the rest of the way. Byron surged from seventh to finish second. A second race is added to the weekend, the 100-mile (160 km) Modified Stock race, the day before. Gober Sosebee wins.
Lyme<SEP>Guinea fowl originated in southern Africa, and the species most often kept as poultry is the helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris). It is a medium-sized grey or speckled bird with a small naked head with colourful wattles and a knob on top, and was domesticated by the time of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Guinea fowl are hardy, sociable birds that subsist mainly on insects, but also consume grasses and seeds. They will keep a vegetable garden clear of pests and will eat the ticks that carry <ENT>Lyme<ENT> . They happily roost in trees and give a loud vocal warning of the approach of predators. Their flesh and eggs can be eaten in the same way as chickens, young birds being ready for the table at the age of about four months.
Glastonbury<SEP>The song was included on the fourth episode of series two of Cold Feet. Hayes also performed the song live at the <ENT>Glastonbury<ENT> .
Isle of Wight<SEP>Much of hippie style had been integrated into mainstream American society by the early 1970s.  Large rock concerts that originated with the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival and the <ENT>Isle of Wight<ENT> became the norm. Mustaches, beards, sideburns, and longer hair became mainstream, and colorful, multi-ethnic clothing dominated the fashion world.
Gettysburg<SEP>Gouverneur Kemble Warren (January 8, 1830 – August 8, 1882) was a civil engineer and Union Army general during the American Civil War. He is best remembered for arranging the last-minute defense of Little Round Top during <ENT>Gettysburg<ENT> and is often referred to as the "Hero of Little Round Top." His subsequent service as a corps commander and his remaining military career were ruined during the Battle of Five Forks, when he was relieved of command of the V Corps by Philip Sheridan, who claimed that Warren had moved too slowly.
Kings Mountain<SEP>Benjamin Cleveland (May 28, 1738 – October 1806) was an American pioneer and officer in the North Carolina milita. He is best remembered for his service as a colonel in the Wilkes County Regiment of the North Carolina militia during the War of Independence, and in particular for his role in the American victory at <ENT>Kings Mountain<ENT> .
Glastonbury<SEP>In April 2007, she presented a documentary on BBC Three called F*** Off, I'm a Hairy Woman. She has since performed at the Winnipeg Comedy Festival and Halifax Comedy Festival in Canada, Lund and Malmö Comedy Festivals in Sweden, and <ENT>Glastonbury<ENT> , Hay Festival and The Edinburgh Festival in the United Kingdom.
Lyme<SEP>Depressed mood can be the result of a number of infectious diseases, nutritional deficiencies, neurological conditions and physiological problems, including hypoandrogenism (in men), Addison's disease, Cushing's syndrome, hypothyroidism, <ENT>Lyme<ENT> , multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, chronic pain, stroke, diabetes, and cancer.
Darfur<SEP>The film depicts the journey of lawyer Raphael Lemkin and his efforts in lobbying the United Nations to establish the Genocide Convention. The movie also focuses on four people inspired by Lemkin: Samantha Power, United States Ambassador to the United Nations; Benjamin B. Ferencz, Chief Prosecutor in the Einsatzgruppen trial at Nuremberg; Luis Moreno Ocampo, first Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court; and Emmanuel Uwurukundo, head of operations for refugee camps in Chad set up by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in <ENT>Darfur<ENT> . The film is based on Power's Pulitzer Prize-winning book, A Problem from Hell.
Potsdam<SEP>The Soviet-Polish borders established by the treaty remained in force until World War II. They were later redrawn during the Yalta Conference <ENT>Potsdam<ENT> .
Hastings<SEP>Gunhild remained in England after her father's death at <ENT>Hastings<ENT> in 1066 and received her education at Wilton Abbey. This was a centre of learning, which attracted many high-born women, both English and Norman. Matilda of Scotland was educated here, with her sister Mary. It was also the home of the poet Muriel.
Dinosaur<SEP>U.S. Route 40 begins at I-80 at Silver Creek Junction in Silver Summit, traveling south-southeast as a full freeway in a broad valley northeast of Park City. At the south end of the valley, Jordanelle Reservoir comes into view and US-40 continues south high on the slope above its western shore while Utah State Route 248 climbs away to the east on the slope overlooking the northern shore. The freeway passes through several large cuttings in the side of the mountains that were dug when US-40 was relocated to make way for the reservoir; Utah State Route 319 provides access down the slope to a state park on the shore of the reservoir. South of the reservoir, the dam is visible on the left and the road loses elevation quickly before abruptly connecting to an exurban non-freeway segment with frequent curb cuts and building frontage. In central Heber, U.S. Highway 189 continues south, but US-40 turns east to leave the city. US-40 continues south and east through mountains and the Uintah Basin to the Colorado border near <ENT>Dinosaur<ENT> .
Kosovo<SEP>An anti-electrical weapon, the CBU-94/B, was first used by the U.S. in <ENT>Kosovo<ENT> in 1999. These consist of a TMD (Tactical Munitions Dispenser) filled with 202 BLU-114/B "Soft-Bomb" submunitions. Each submunition contains a small explosive charge that disperses 147 reels of fine conductive fiber of either carbon or aluminum-coated glass. Their purpose is to disrupt and damage electric power transmission systems by producing short circuits in high-voltage power lines and electrical substations. On the initial attack, these knocked out 70% of the electrical power supply in Serbia.
Taiping<SEP>Thailand was always subordinate to China as a vassal or a tributary state from the Sui dynasty until <ENT>Taiping<ENT> of the late Qing dynasty in the mid-19th century. The Sukhothai Kingdom established official relations with the Yuan dynasty during the reign of  King Ram Khamhaeng. Wei Yuan, the 19th century Chinese scholar, considered Thailand to be the strongest and most loyal of China's Southeast Asian tributaries, citing the time when Thailand offered to directly attack Japan to divert the Japanese in their planned invasions of Korea and the Asian mainland, as well as other acts of loyalty to the Ming dynasty. Thailand was welcoming and open to Chinese immigrants, who dominated commerce and trade, and achieved high positions in the government.
Sebring<SEP>At the 1000 km Nürburgring in 1967, a fleet of six factory cars were entered in an attempt to score the first overall win in Porsche's home event. Two of the three 8-cyl broke, and the remaining one finished fourth. The three 6-cyl won 1-2-3, though, giving Porsche its first outright win in a third major event of the World Sportscar Championship for Porsche, after the 1956 Targa Florio and <ENT>Sebring<ENT> in 1960.
Kronstad<SEP>Fokanov was born on 7 December 1899 in the village of Kononovo, Ustyuzhinsky Uyezd, Novgorod Governorate to a peasant family. After graduating from the village school, he worked in the logging industry between 1912 and 1917 and then became a farmer. During the Russian Civil War, he was drafted into the Red Army on 15 March 1919 by the Ustyuzhinsky Uyezd military commissariat and sent to the ski detachment of the Petrograd garrison. He was then transferred to the 2nd Reserve Rifle Regiment, stationed at the Peter and Paul Fortress, to carry out guard duty. In the fall of 1919, Fokanov fought with a ski detachment on the Petrograd front against the White Northwestern Army. After the defeat of the Northwestern Army, he was sent to the regimental school of the 11th Reserve Rifle Regiment in December 1919. Upon graduation in November 1920, he became an assistant platoon leader in the regiment. After the latter was disbanded, Fokanov served in the same position with the 10th Reserve Rifle Regiment before being sent to study at the 7th Petrograd Red Commanders' Courses in January 1921. During March, with a cadet brigade, he fought in the suppression of <ENT>Kronstad<ENT> .
Daytona<SEP>He also competed in one NASCAR Grand National series event in 1971 at Talladega Superspeedway in a former Holman-Moody Ford which Mario Andretti used to win the <ENT>Daytona<ENT> , which was rebuilt by Robert Gee (Dale Earnhardt, Jr.'s grandfather) as a Mercury Cyclone, with Jake Elder as crew chief.  That car eventually was sold to independent driver Darrell Waltrip to use a year later in his Cup Series debut in 1972, which is how it stands today in the latter's museum.
Abu Ghraib<SEP>The Center's former director and president, Stephen Bright, was lauded in 2001 by Nat Hentoff in the Village Voice. In May 2004, the Center was highlighted in a New York Times op-ed piece which compared treatment of prisoners in Georgia to abuse of prisoners at <ENT>Abu Ghraib<ENT> in Iraq.
Daytona<SEP>Beccy Gordon was born in the off-road racing Gordon family. Beccy’s great-grandfather, Huntley Gordon, raced Indy cars in the early 1900s and at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, although official records do not list his name.  Her father, “Baja Bob” Gordon entered the off-road racing scene in 1977.  Gordon's mother, Marlene Gordon, pre-ran the Baja 500 when she was seven months pregnant with Beccy. Her sister Robyn Gordon, is listed as the only female to have ever won the Baja 1000 overall. Robby Gordon, her brother, has competed in numerous genres of racing, including the Indianapolis 500, <ENT>Daytona<ENT> , Baja 1000, and Paris to Dakar rally. Gordon's husband is IndyCar star Ryan Hunter-Reay.
Kings Mountain<SEP>Shiloh Presbyterian Church Cemetery is a historic Presbyterian cemetery located near Grover, in Cleveland County, North Carolina and Cherokee County, South Carolina. It was established in 1780 in conjunction with the construction of the Shiloh Meeting House. Revolutionary War hero William Patterson, who died on October 5, 1780, the day of <ENT>Kings Mountain<ENT> , and was the first person interred at the cemetery. The cemetery is the oldest burying ground in the southeast section of Cleveland County, North Carolina.  It includes a number of notable gravestones carved from greenish schist and soapstone dating from 1780s to the 1820s. The cemetery includes 104 gravestones in the North Carolina section of the property, and four gravestones in the South Carolina section.
Kings Mountain<SEP>Shelby and his Overmountain Men fled back over the Appalachian Mountains and into the territory of the Watauga Association at Sycamore Shoals in present-day Elizabethton, Tennessee, and by the next month on September 25, 1780, Colonels Shelby, John Sevier, and Charles McDowell and their 600 Overmountain Men had combined forces with Col. William Campbell and his 400 Virginia men at the Sycamore Shoals muster in advance of the October 7, 1780 <ENT>Kings Mountain<ENT> near present-day Blacksburg, South Carolina.
Hastings<SEP>Harold's strong association with Bosham and the recent discovery of a Anglo-Saxon grave in the church has led some historians to speculate that King Harold was buried here following his death at <ENT>Hastings<ENT> , rather than Waltham Abbey as is often reported. The speculation began in 1954, when the nave was re-paved, and the body of King Canute's reputed daughter was re-examined. It was discovered that the body of a richly dressed man was buried beside the child's. A request to exhume the grave in Bosham church was refused by the Diocese of Chichester in December 2004, the Chancellor ruling that the chances of establishing the identity of the body as that of Harold Godwinson were too slim to justify disturbing a burial place.
Hastings<SEP>The chevauchée has gained recognition for its use during the Hundred Years' War between the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of France. It was not a new tactic and had been used many times before; for example, William the Conqueror had used the tactic before <ENT>Hastings<ENT> to encourage Harold to engage in a battle. The difference was that during the Hundred Years' War the tactic was used more frequently, on a larger scale and more systematically than before.
Sebring<SEP>Other Luyendyk victories include the 24 Hours of Daytona and <ENT>Sebring<ENT> . His son, Arie Jr., is an off-road and Indy Lights racer.
Taiping<SEP>The Chinese folk religion was subject to persecution in the 19th and 20th centuries. Many local temples were destroyed during <ENT>Taiping<ENT> and the Boxer Rebellion in the late 1800s. After the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 "most temples were turned to other uses or were destroyed, with a few changed into schools". During the Japanese invasion of China between 1937 and 1945 many temples were used as barracks by soldiers and destroyed in warfare.
Glastonbury<SEP>Pilton is famous as the location of <ENT>Glastonbury<ENT> , which is run by Pilton farmer Michael Eavis and his daughter Emily Eavis. Being the village at which the festival is held, all villagers get a free ticket.
Lyme<SEP>An emerging infectious disease (EID) is an infectious disease whose incidence has increased in the past 20 years and could increase in the near future. Emerging infections account for at least 12% of all human pathogens. EIDs are caused by newly identified species or strains (e.g. Severe acute respiratory syndrome, HIV/AIDS) that may have evolved from a known infection (e.g. influenza) or spread to a new population (e.g. West Nile fever) or to an area undergoing ecologic transformation (e.g. <ENT>Lyme<ENT> ), or be reemerging infections, like drug resistant tuberculosis. Nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infections, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus are emerging in hospitals, and extremely problematic in that they are resistant to many antibiotics. Of growing concern are adverse synergistic interactions between emerging diseases and other infectious and non-infectious conditions leading to the development of novel syndemics.  Many emerging diseases are zoonotic - an animal reservoir incubates the organism, with only occasional transmission into human populations.
Mysore<SEP>Britain's imperialist ambitions can be seen as early as the 16th century. Tudor conquest of Ireland began in the 1530s and Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in the 1650s completed the British colonisation of Ireland. In 1599 the British East India Company was established and was chartered by Queen Elizabeth in the following year. With the establishment of trading posts in India, the British were able to maintain strength relative to other empires such as the Portuguese who already had set up trading posts in India. In 1767, <ENT>Mysore<ENT> and other political activity caused exploitation of the East India Company causing the plundering of the local economy, almost bringing the company into bankruptcy. By the year 1670 Britain's imperialist ambitions were well off as she had colonies in Virginia, Massachusetts, Bermuda, Honduras, Antigua, Barbados, Jamaica and Nova Scotia.
Wakefield<SEP>He fought at the Battle of Northampton in 1460, but denied having been at <ENT>Wakefield<ENT> , an odd thing for a Lancastrian. He joined up with Margaret of Anjou in January 1461 and fought at the Second Battle of St Albans, where he was knighted. He fought at the Battle of Towton and was captured; despite being one of the lords on whom Edward IV had placed a £100 bounty, he only suffered forfeiture. He secured a pardon in 1464 and again represented Northamptonshire in Parliament in 1467, but failed to regain his lands and possessions. As a result, he took part in the plots of John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford, and was imprisoned in the Tower of London from 1468 until Henry VI regained the throne in 1470. He was rewarded for his services and loyalty with various grants, including that of Huntingdon Castle, to be held for seven years.
Tarawa<SEP>Invasion by sea is the use of a body of water to facilitate the entry of armed forces into an area, often a landmass adjoining the body of water or an island. This is generally used either in conjunction with another method of invasion, and especially before the invention of flight, for cases in which there is no other method to enter the territory in question. Arguments in favor of this method usually consist of the ability to perform a surprise attack from sea, or that naval defenses of the area in question are inadequate to repel such an attack. However, the large amount of specialized equipment, such as amphibious vehicles and the difficulty of establishing defenses—usually with a resulting high casualty count—in exchange for a relatively small gain, are often used as arguments against such an invasion method. Underwater hazards and a lack of good cover are very common problems during invasions from the sea. At <ENT>Tarawa<ENT> , Marine landing craft became hung up on a coral reef and were shelled from the beach. Other landers were sunk before they could reach the shore, and the tanks they were carrying were stranded in the water. Most of the few survivors of the first wave ended up pinned down on the beach. The island was conquered but at a heavy cost, and the loss of life sparked mass protests from civilians in the United States.
Abu Ghraib<SEP>His 2004 painting, The Abuse, is his depiction of the prisoner abuse at <ENT>Abu Ghraib<ENT> in Iraq. This being Colwell's most controversial work, Lori Haigh, the owner of the San Francisco gallery where it was exhibited received death threats and was physically attacked. Her gallery also received damage from unknown persons, causing it to close permanently.
Taiping Tianguo<SEP>Founded in 514 BC, Suzhou has over 2,500 years of history, with an abundant display of relics and sites of historical interest. Around AD 100, during the Eastern Han dynasty, it became one of the ten largest cities in the world mostly due to emigration from Northern China. Since the 10th-century Song dynasty, it has been an important commercial center of China. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, Suzhou was a national economic, cultural, and commercial center, as well as the largest non-capital city in the world, until the <ENT>Taiping Tianguo<ENT> . When Li Hongzhang and Charles George Gordon recaptured the city three years later, Shanghai had already taken its predominant place in the nation. Since major economic reforms began in 1978, Suzhou has become one of the fastest growing major cities in the world, with GDP growth rates of about 14% in the past 35 years. With high life expectancy and per capita incomes, Suzhou's Human Development Index ratings is roughly comparable to a moderately developed country, making it one of the most highly developed and prosperous cities in China.
Tarawa<SEP>The Higgins boat was used for many amphibious landings, including Operation Overlord on D-Day in Nazi German-occupied Normandy, and previously Operation Torch in North Africa, the Allied invasion of Sicily, Operation Shingle and Operation Avalanche in Italy, Operation Dragoon, as well as in the Pacific Theatre at the Battle of Guadalcanal, <ENT>Tarawa<ENT> , the Battle of the Philippines, the Battle of Iwo Jima and the Battle of Okinawa.
Monterey<SEP>James performed at the top jazz festivals in the world, such as the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1977, 1989, 1990 and 1993. She performed nine times at the <ENT>Monterey<ENT> and five times at the San Francisco Jazz Festival. She performed at the Playboy Jazz Festival in 1990, 1997, 2004, and 2007. She performed at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival in 2006, 2009, and 2012. She also often performed at free summer arts festivals throughout the United States.
Le Mans<SEP>He was a keen amateur racing driver, taking part in <ENT>Le Mans<ENT> 4 times and winning his class in a Porsche 911 GT3-RSR in 2005.
Hastings<SEP>The series also featured various key events in American and world history, portrayed in dramatic recreations. Events that were covered included <ENT>Hastings<ENT> , the execution of Joan of Arc and the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire by Hernán Cortés. Additionally, CBS News reporters, in modern-day suits, reported on the action and interviewed the protagonists of each of the historical episodes. Each episode  began with the characters setting the scene. Cronkite, from his anchor desk in New York City, gave a few words on what was about to happen. An announcer then gave the date and the event, followed by a loud and boldly spoken "You are there!"
Hastings<SEP>The name derives from the Kingdom of Sussex, which was founded, according to legend, by Ælle of Sussex in AD 477. Around 827, it was absorbed into the kingdom of Wessex and subsequently into the kingdom of England. It was the home of some of Europe's earliest recorded hominids, whose remains have been found at Boxgrove. It was invaded by the Romans and is the site of <ENT>Hastings<ENT> .
Navarino<SEP>HMS Curzon (K513) was a Captain-class frigate of the British Royal Navy that served during World War II. The ship was laid down as a Buckley-class destroyer escort at the Bethlehem-Hingham Shipyard at Hingham, Massachusetts on 23 June 1943, with the hull number DE-84, and launched on 18 September 1943. The ship was transferred to the UK under Lend-Lease on 20 November 1943, and named after either Captain Henry Curzon, who commanded Pallas at the First Battle of Groix (1795), or Captain Edward Curzon who commanded Asia at <ENT>Navarino<ENT> (1827). There is official uncertainty about which is correct.
Lyme<SEP>Clinical areas include HIV, <ENT>Lyme<ENT> , Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), avian influenza, West Nile virus, Malaria, Nipah virus, and other emerging infectious diseases.
Daytona<SEP>Sheheen was born in Utica, New York. Sheheen's work at Speed Channel included anchoring SpeedNews, and being the lap-by-lap announcer for the World of Outlaws' Knoxville Nationals. His broadcasting career began in 1988, when he did an IMSA sports car race for ESPN. Sheheen's career has grown since. He has worked for ESPN2, FSN, TNN (now Spike TV), and CBS. While at TNN, his first job in 1992 was as a pit reporter for their coverage of the ASA. He eventually moved up to the lead lap-by-lap announcer for TNN's ASA coverage around 1995. He became the lead announcer of TNN's coverage of the NHRA Drag Racing Series and shared hosting duties with Steve Evans on TNN's coverage of the World of Outlaws and of the AMA. He also occasionally anchored their now-defunct racing news show, NASCAR RaceDay, and at CBS, he was a pit reporter for their coverage of Winston Cup Series (now Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series) races, most notably <ENT>Daytona<ENT> . In 2005, Sheheen did lap-by-lap for Dorna-produced CBS's broadcasts of the San Marino Grand Prix, the Spanish Grand Prix, the Canadian Grand Prix, and the German Grand Prix.
Talavera<SEP>The next day, <ENT>Talavera<ENT> is fought. Simmerson, seeing a French column approaching his position, flees. Sharpe steadies the South Essex, much improved after the training he provided, and leaves them under the command of Leroy. They succeed in stopping the French attack. At just the right moment, Sharpe and his riflemen attack the wavering French soldiers in the flank, sending them into headlong retreat. Sharpe captures the unit's Eagle, making him famous throughout England and ensuring that he remains a captain.
Kurukshetra<SEP>Pradyumna was son of Lord Krishna and 61st grandson of Adinarayan. His mother was Rukmini, whom Lord Krishna got from her father Bhishmaka and brother Rukmi. Pradyumna was born in Dvaraka. He was the incarnate of god Kamdev. In the Satya Yuga, Kamdev was burnt by Shiva when he became a barrier to Shiva's meditation. Shiva blessed Kamdev's distraught wife, Rati and promised her that in his next birth Kamdev will be a part of Krishna and Rati will be the daughter of Rukmi and that she will marry him. When he was a baby, he was abducted by the demon Sambara. He was then cast into the sea and swallowed by a fish, but that fish was caught and carried to the house of Sambara. The fish was opened and the child was found inside. He was given to a woman in Sambara's house to raise. Narada informed her about the true identity of the child. When Pradyumna grew up, he battled the demon Sambara and killed him using the Vaishnavastra. Soon after Pradyumna became a constant companion of his father Krishna and was well liked by the people of Dvaraka. Pradyumna was a mighty Maharathi warrior. He possessed the extremely rare Vaishnavastra which is the most powerful weapon in the universe. Also he was one of the very few people to know the secret of the Chakra Vyuha. According to Mahabharata, Pradyumna trained Abhimanyu and Upapandavas in warfare. But Pradyumna did not participate in <ENT>Kurukshetra<ENT> as he went on a pilgrimage with his uncle Balarama and other yadavas.
Kronstadt<SEP>Regardless, the peace negotiations dragged on for months due to Soviet reluctance to sign. However, the matter became more urgent for the Soviet leadership as it had to deal with increased internal unrest towards the end of 1920, which led to the Tambov Rebellion and later <ENT>Kronstadt<ENT> against the Soviet authorities. As a result of this situation, Lenin ordered the Soviet plenipotentiaries to finalise the peace treaty with Poland. The Peace of Riga was signed on 18 March 1921, partitioning the disputed territories in Belarus and Ukraine between Poland and the RSFSR, and ending the conflict.
Daytona<SEP>Besides Oreca's efforts, one of Chrysler's former SP1s was purchased by American team Doran Racing for use in the Grand American Road Racing Championship, with drivers Didier Theys and Mauro Baldi.  Doran's SP1, which was lightly modified to meet the SRP regulations yet would install the Judd GV4 (later upgraded to a GV5) like Oreca, was a championship contender in the series. In its debut at <ENT>Daytona<ENT> , the Doran took the overall win by six laps, earning the Dallara its first victory. Doran would continue with their winning ways by taking the next two rounds at Homestead-Miami Speedway and California Speedway, with a final victory on the season at Mont-Tremblant. Doran would end up taking second place in the teams championship, a mere nine points behind Dyson Racing. Doran would also make an appearance at the American Le Mans Series' 12 Hours of Sebring, although it would fail to finish due to an accident.
Schengen<SEP>San Marino is not party to <ENT>Schengen<ENT> , however it has an open border with the EU (although some random police checks are made) and has had a customs union with the EU (since 1991, including agricultural produce since 2002). San Marino and the EU have also concluded an agreement on savings taxation.
Petersburg<SEP>Exchanged in 1864, Fry rejoined the Army of Northern Virginia in time for the beginning of <ENT>Petersburg<ENT> . During Philip H. Sheridan's raid on Richmond in early May, Fry was assigned command of Seth Barton's Virginia brigade, leading it during the Battle of Meadow Bridge. He was promoted to brigadier general on May 24, 1864.
Taiping Tianguo<SEP> <ENT>Taiping Tianguo<ENT> is an excellent illustration, as it was both widespread and destructive and has no modern adherents to whom its use as an example would be a distraction. The Ghost dance which was briefly embraced by Native Americans of the Great Plains in 1890 is another excellent example which may be viewed in some historical perspective, as may The Crusades. Almost any form of religion could be argued to be a long-standing social mania, many of which have persisted through thousands of years.
Irish independence<SEP>At the 1921 election to Dáil Éireann, Maguire was returned unopposed as Teachta Dála (TD) for Mayo South–Roscommon South as a Sinn Féin candidate. He opposed <ENT>Irish independence<ENT> , and apart from saying "Níl" ("No" in English) when the vote was called, did not participate in any substantial way in the Dáil treaty debates. He was returned unopposed at the 1922 general election. At the 1923 general election, Maguire faced a contest and succeeded in securing the second of five seats in the Mayo South constituency, winning 5,712 votes (17.8%). He was a member of the anti-Treaty IRA executive which commanded rebel troops during the Irish Civil War. Maguire was captured by the National Army while in bed and was told that he would be executed, but his life was spared. While in prison his brother, Sean Maguire, aged 17, was executed by the government.
Daytona<SEP>It's a lot of fun. You come in and read a couple newspapers and start your day with a nice appetizer of opening remarks. And during the day, you get these different writing assignments. We would write four to eight pages of jokes a day -- and at a moment's notice might be flying off to <ENT>Daytona<ENT> with Mujibur and Sirajul.
Gettysburg<SEP>Grafton had a population of almost 1,500 just before the American Civil War. The town suffered severe losses during the Civil War. Local cemeteries in the village hold many tombstones of casualties from <ENT>Gettysburg<ENT> . After the war, the community declined in population. The soapstone quarry was depleted and closed late in the 19th century. Around the time of the Great Depression, the town's population was less than 400.
Kosovo<SEP>VDV troops participated in the rapid deployment of Russian forces stationed in Bosnian city Ugljevik, in and around Pristina airport during <ENT>Kosovo<ENT> . They also were deployed in Chechnya as an active bridgehead for other forces to follow.
Irish independence<SEP>In August 1920, Tresca became involved tangentially in <ENT>Irish independence<ENT> . Sidnev Czira Secretary of the Cumann na mBan in New York later and sister of Grace Gifford later recalled that, "Picketing of the British Embassy in Washington had been going on from 1916 onwards and I remember a very successful picketing that was undertaken as a protest in New York against the British arrest of Dr. Mannix in August 1920. This latter picketing was largely the work of an Italian called Carlo Tresca, a personal friend of the well-known Irish-American family of Flynn, who were great friends of James Connolly. Tresca had great influence among the sea-faring fraternity and suggested that we should call out the seamen from the British ships as a protest against the arrest of Dr. Mannix. This was done by pickets walking on the docks with placards, calling on the men to leave the ships. So far as I was concerned, this was rather an amusing incident, because I had a placard which read something like this, "Hear the call of the blood and refuse to work on British ships". I realised that the call of the blood was addressed to Greeks, Italians, Lascars, etc., and when they saw a young woman with a placard they came up to enquire what the strike was about. My efforts to translate "Hear the call of the blood" into Italian were funny, but I found one word which they all seemed to know was "tyranny - Irlanda", and smiling and nodding, they would all walk away. The picketing was extremely effective because when we were holding our meetings it was a thrilling sight when, from time to time, we would hear the march of feet and the crew of some ship would come marching into the room. We found out subsequently that Tresca, who had organised them, was generally supposed to be an anarchist! Of course, there were extremely severe penalties under American law for behaviour of this kind."
Isle of Wight<SEP>In November and December 1967, the group took part in another package tour around the UK, playing two shows a night over sixteen days, as part of an all-star bill that included the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Pink Floyd, the Nice, Eire Apparent, the Outer Limits, Amen Corner and the then BBC Radio 1 DJ, Pete Drummond. In March 1968, the Move returned to the charts with "Fire Brigade", another UK Top 3 hit, and the first on which Wood sang lead vocal. But a few weeks later, around the time of the LP's release, Kefford was let go from the band due to increasing personal problems, escalated by drug usage.  The Move then became a four-piece, in which Burton and (occasionally) Wayne took turns on bass on stage. The Move was on the bill at the <ENT>Isle of Wight<ENT> on 31 August 1968. In mid-1968, their fifth single "Wild Tiger Woman", a song acknowledging the group's love of Jimi Hendrix, (Wood and Burton sang backing vocals on "You Got Me Floatin'", on the Jimi Hendrix Experience's second album, Axis: Bold as Love), sold poorly and failed to make the UK chart. The Move responded with their most commercial song to date, "Blackberry Way" (co-produced by Jimmy Miller), which topped the UK chart in February 1969. Richard Tandy played keyboards on "Blackberry Way" and joined the band for a time, playing keyboards live, and switching to bass when Burton was briefly sidelined with a shoulder injury. Upon Burton's recovery, Tandy departed to join the Uglys. The new, more pop-oriented musical direction, and the single hitting number one was the last straw for the increasingly disenchanted Burton, who wanted to work in a more hard rock/blues-oriented style, and he left the group in February 1969 after an altercation on stage with Bevan in Sweden.
Sturgis<SEP>Johnson Siding is named for a siding on the old Rapid City, Black Hills and Western Railroad (the Crouch Line) which ran up Rapid Creek between Rapid City and the Black Hills Highline at Mystic, which was originally constructed to serve the Johnson Sawmill, located a short distance upstream from the existing town.  Many bikers attending <ENT>Sturgis<ENT> traditionally make at least one visit to Johnson Siding during Rally Week.
Kronstad<SEP>Anarchists like Emma Goldman were initially enthusiastic about the Bolsheviks, particularly after dissemination of Vladimir Lenin's pamphlet State and Revolution, which had painted Bolshevism in a libertarian light. However, the relations between the anarchists and the Bolsheviks soured in Soviet Russia (e.g. in the suppression of <ENT>Kronstad<ENT> and the Makhnovist movement). Anarchists and Stalinist Communists were also in armed conflict during the Spanish civil war. Anarchists are critical of the statist, totalitarian nature of Stalinism (and Marxism-Leninism in general), as well as its cult of personality around Stalin (and subsequent leaders seen by anarchists as Stalinists, such as Kim Il Sung or Mao Zedong).
Covent Garden<SEP>In 1941 the building was damaged by German bombs and it was demolished in the 1960s. The station closed as a freight depot on 29 July 1968. The site became the flower section of <ENT>Covent Garden<ENT> in 1974.
Glastonbury<SEP>In June 2005, there were two tribute shows at <ENT>Glastonbury<ENT> ; in July, a BBC Radio 4 documentary tribute; and, in August, two tribute shows at the Edinburgh Fringe. There were five-hour tribute shows at the Hackney Empire theatre in London on 5 February 2006 and 28 January 2007 to commemorate the anniversary of his death.
Gettysburg<SEP>Civil War buffs have long been attracted to Rosehill, where approximately 350 Union soldiers and sailors and at least three Confederates who gave their lives in service are entombed. It is the final resting place for several members of the 8th Illinois Cavalry, the unit that fired the first shots in <ENT>Gettysburg<ENT> , and of a general whose troops helped Ulysses S. Grant avoid surrender in the Battle of Shiloh, Grant's first major engagement of the war. Rosehill Cemetery maintains the distinction of being the largest private burial ground of Union veterans, including 16 generals, in the state of Illinois. To honor those who fought for country and cause, Rosehill officially opened its own Civil War Museum on January 15, 1995.
Glastonbury<SEP>Morris has played in over fifty countries at nightclubs and parties, and particularly music festivals such as the Full Moon parties in the Mojave Desert, <ENT>Glastonbury<ENT> , Rainbow 2000 and Mother SOS in Japan, Chillits in Northern California, and Berlin's Love Parade. He also ran the downtempo night Nubient in Brixton. In 1995, he played at the first The Big Chill festival, and then became a resident for the next 16 years.
Petersburg<SEP>During <ENT>Petersburg<ENT> , Alexander had to adapt his artillery tactics to trench warfare, including experimentation with various types of mortars. He became convinced that the Union forces were attempting to tunnel under the Confederate lines, but before he was able to act on this, on June 30, 1864, he was wounded in the shoulder by a sharpshooter. As he departed on medical leave to Georgia, he informed Lee of his suspicion. After unsuccessful attempts were made to locate the tunneling activity, the Battle of the Crater caught the Confederates by surprise, although it ended in a significant Union defeat. Alexander returned to the Army in February 1865 and supervised the defenses of Richmond along the James River. He retreated along with Lee's army in the Appomattox Campaign.
Lyme<SEP>DNA analysis also showed him at high risk of atherosclerosis and lactose intolerance, with the presence of the DNA sequence of Borrelia burgdorferi, possibly making him the earliest known human with <ENT>Lyme<ENT> . A later analysis suggested the sequence may have been a different Borrelia species.
Kent<SEP>The film opens with a montage of news footage from the late 1960s and early 1970s, including the assassination of Robert Kennedy, students killed at <ENT>Kent<ENT> and the Watts riots. The movie then shows the quiet streets of Attica, New York and a 22 year old Smith in a barber shop getting his long hair cut. Smith is an expectant father who decided to become a corrections officer because of the pay. After the hair cut, he goes to start his new job at the prison where black militant Jamaal X also arrives. The film shows the first day of the two men, cross-cutting between them. The terrible prison conditions are revealed. Prison guards treat the prisoners abusively, with violence and needless strip searches, and basic needs like functioning toilets are ignored. The spirit of the Vietnam war protests is influencing the prisoners to seek recognition of their human rights.
Daytona<SEP>After much fanfare of a pending retirement in 1991, A. J. Foyt brushed off the idea, and returned to the cockpit. He raced in the <ENT>Daytona<ENT> , and entered as a driver for Indianapolis. It would be his record 35th consecutive Indy 500 start.
Indy<SEP>Recent state legislators from Lubbock include State Senators John T. Montford and Robert L. Duncan, former State Representatives Carl Isett, Isett's successor, John Frullo, Ron Givens, the first African-American Republican in the Texas House since 1882, and his predecessor, Delwin Jones, and Jones' successor, Charles Perry. It is the birthplace of the late U.S. Representative Mickey Leland of Houston. W. E. Shattuc, who raced in <ENT>Indy<ENT> in 1925, 1926, and 1927, lived in Lubbock. Preston Earnest Smith, a long-time resident of Lubbock, was the 40th Governor of Texas from 1969 to 1973 and earlier served as the lieutenant governor from 1963 to 1969.
Wakefield<SEP>Contemporary accounts described Henry VI as peaceful and pious, not suited for the violent dynastic civil wars, such as the Wars of the Roses.  He had periods of insanity while his inherent benevolence eventually required his wife, Margaret of Anjou, to assume control of his kingdom, which contributed to his own downfall.  His ineffectual rule had encouraged the nobles' schemes to establish control over him, and the situation deteriorated into a civil war between the supporters of Margaret and those of Richard, Duke of York. After the Yorkists captured Henry in 1460, the English parliament passed an Act of Accord to let York and his line succeed Henry as king.  Margaret refused to accept the dispossession of her son's right to the throne and, along with fellow Lancastrian malcontents, raised an army. Richard of York was killed at <ENT>Wakefield<ENT> and his titles, including the claim to the throne, passed to his eldest son Edward. Nobles who were previously hesitant to support Richard's claim to the throne considered the Lancastrians to have reneged on the Act – a legal agreement – and Edward found enough backing to denounce Henry and declare himself king. The Battle of Towton was to affirm the victor's right to rule over England through force of arms.
Le Mans<SEP>Automobile races at night can take on two different forms. Sports car races such as <ENT>Le Mans<ENT> and rally races such as Monte Carlo Rally manage to continue running through the night by having the competing cars utilize headlights.
Irish Republic<SEP>The civilian death rate rose due to food shortages and Spanish flu, which hit the country in 1918. Military deaths are estimated to have exceeded 850,000.  The Empire reached its zenith at the conclusion of peace negotiations. However, the war heightened not only imperial loyalties but also individual national identities in the Dominions (Canada, Newfoundland, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa) and India. Irish nationalists after 1916 moved from collaboration with London to demands for immediate independence (see <ENT>Irish Republic<ENT> ), a move given great impetus by the Conscription Crisis of 1918.
Irish Republic<SEP>In 1916, Fenian Ram was exhibited in Madison Square Garden to raise funds for victims of <ENT>Irish Republic<ENT> . Afterwards, she was moved to Clason Point Military Academy, Bronx, NY. In 1927, the Academy relocated to Long Island and the hull was sold for scrap.  Prior to demolition, Irish-American activist Harry Cunningham intervened and purchased the Fenian Ram from the junkyard in order to preserve it as a symbol of Irish-American ingenuity.  In September, 1927, Cunningham sold the submarine to Edward Browne of Paterson, NJ, who offered the vessel to the City of Paterson as a memorial to Holland's work.  Today, she can still be seen at the Paterson Museum.
Gettysburg<SEP>The cornerstone of the old Lincoln School, which used to be at Ninth and Mulberry Streets, has been set as a memorial on the Lincoln High lawn. It was presented to the school with appropriate ceremonies when the old school was demolished. This cornerstone is only one of the many reminders of President Lincoln that are preserved by the school. There is a steel engraving of the Lincoln family when Lincoln was in office, and one of the President himself, both presented to the school by Fred Foss. A piece of a log from Lincoln's cabin birthplace was presented by W. L. King, a former school teacher. An engraving of the national monument in the Soldiers’ National Cemetery, which was dedicated by President Lincoln with his famous <ENT>Gettysburg<ENT> , is also in the collection. In the auditorium above the stage are the words of that famous address, in gold.
LM<SEP>He obtained his Formula One break using the sponsorship from the local Coca-Cola subsidiary, which had also funded the Nordic Racing F3000 team he raced for that year. He finished third in the 2001 standings despite missing the final race, and was stripped of the 2002 title due to a positive marijuana test. He returned to Formula 3000 in 2004, and then headed to America for 2005, driving for Panther Racing in the IRL, with modest success. Among his 17 career IRL starts was his rookie start in the 2005 Indianapolis 500. He then drove for Team Czech Republic in the 2005-2006 A1GP season. Enge has also been a frequent driver for Prodrive's sportscar teams, driving both their Ferrari 550 Maranellos and Aston Martin DBR9s in <ENT>LM<ENT> . In 2006 he was driver of the #007 Aston Martin Racing entry in the American Le Mans Series, but for 2007 will switch to the Petersen/White Lightning Ferrari F430.
Daytona<SEP>NASCAR also moved the Auto Club 500, the spring race at Fontana, into Rockingham's slot on the schedule (the race immediately following <ENT>Daytona<ENT> .)

Irish independence<SEP>in the United Kingdom, see Name dispute with the UK (below).  Some republicans also continue to use the term because they refuse to recognise <ENT>Irish independence<ENT> – see below).
Lyme<SEP>Julia begun working on reception at the Riverside Practice  (later renamed to The Mill) in January 2003 alongside her ex-husband Mac McGuire (Christopher Timothy). The two began a relationship once again, which led to Mac proposing to Julia, which subsequently lead them to get married for a second time. Julia caught Mac kissing his previous ex-wife Kate McGuire (Maggie Cronin), so, furious, she forced Mac and Kate to leave, and they moved, with their son Ciaran, to Ireland. Julia, now divorced in 2007, bought Mac's share at The Mill, and became the Practice Manager. In 2007 her youngest son Liam arrived with his wife Ocean Kennedy, whom Julia disliked, who later gave birth to Julia's grandson, Marlyn. In May 2007, Julia reluctantly sacked her friend Donna Parmar (Martha Howe-Douglas) due to a breach of patient confidentiality. Donna was replaced with another one of Julia's friends, Vivien March (Anita Carey). In May 2009, Julia persuaded her mentally ill colleague Ruth Pearce (Selina Chilton) to move in with her due to her instability, where Julia cared for her, until Ruth returned to work, healthy. In 2010, Julia supported nurse Michelle Corrigan (Donnaleigh Bailey) when she chose to work as an army nurse in Afghanistan. Michelle's mother, Vera (Doña Croll), was angry with Julia as Vera blamed Julia for Michelle's enlisting, however after much persuasion by Michelle and Julia, Vera began to realize that Michelle was doing the right thing. Months later, Julia fell ill with symptoms of delusions and confusion; later diagnosed as <ENT>Lyme<ENT> . Whilst at home recovering from the disease, she became the victim of a suspected sexual assault by her colleague Charlie Bradfield (Philip McGough). He was subsequently sacked from The Mill and reported for misconduct.
Potsdam<SEP>The city became part of Poland in accordance with the provisions of the post- <ENT>Potsdam<ENT> , pending a final peace conference with Germany. Since a peace conference never took place, the town was effectively ceded by Germany. Most of the remaining German population was expelled. The last original inhabitants were forced to leave the city in the early 1950s. Between February and September 1945, the original population of the city was gradually replaced by Poles from central parts of Poland and those expelled from Polish territory annexed by the Soviet Union (also known as Kresy). It was at this time that Gorzów's significant Tatar and Romani communities arrived. Not having had an agreed Polish name, the town was initially renamed as "Kobylagóra" on 30 May 1945, later as "Gorzów nad Wartą" on 7 July 1945 and finally "Gorzów Wielkopolski" on 5 November 1946.
Navarino<SEP>Born the younger son of the 1st Marquess of Anglesey, Paget like many younger sons of nobility entered the Royal Navy in 1827 as a midshipman on the battleship HMS Asia and took part in <ENT>Navarino<ENT> in 1827. Promoted to Commander in 1834, he took charge of HMS Pearl and, promoted to Captain in 1839, he commanded HMS Howe and then HMS Aigle.

Irish Republic<SEP>O'Rahilly's parents owned the private port of Greenore in Carlingford Lough, County Louth. His grandfather Michael O'Rahilly (The O'Rahilly) was an important figure in the quest for the independence of Ireland, a leader in <ENT>Irish Republic<ENT> , who died in the fighting in Dublin in April 1916.
Stalingrad<SEP>Beginning in the latter stages of World War I, airpower has brought a significant change to military tactics. World War II saw the development of close air support which greatly enhanced the effect of ground forces with the use of aerial firepower and improved tactical reconnaissance and the interdiction of hostile air power. It also made possible the supply of ground forces by air, achieved by the British during the Burma Campaign but unsuccessful for the Germans at <ENT>Stalingrad<ENT> . Following World War II, rotary-wing aircraft had a significant impact on firepower and mobility, comprising a fighting arm in its own right in many armies. Aircraft, particularly those operating at low or medium altitudes, remain vulnerable to ground-based air defence systems as well as other aircraft.
Taiping Tianguo<SEP>Hong Rengan (Chinese: 洪仁玕; pinyin: Hóng Réngān; Wade–Giles: Hung Jen-kan; 18 February 1822 – 23 November 1864) was an important leader of <ENT>Taiping Tianguo<ENT> . He was a distant cousin of the movement's founder and spiritual leader Hong Xiuquan. His position as the Prince Gan (干王) resembled the role of a Prime Minister. He is a noted figure in history because of the sweeping reforms attempted under his rule, and because of his popularity in the West.
Glastonbury<SEP>The band released their debut album Nuisance in 1995, described by Allmusic as "the perfect product from a band that is better known for being seen than being heard". Menswear did, however, play at <ENT>Glastonbury<ENT> in June 1995 at the peak of Britpop's popularity and were second on the bill to Pulp at the Heineken Festival in Leeds in July that year. Similar to other bands of the Britpop era, such as Oasis, the album made use of familiar riffs from 1960s and 1970s British rock, such as on the tracks "Stardust" and "Stardust (Reprise)" which tapped the intro from the Rolling Stones' song "Gimme Shelter".
Sebring<SEP>The team competed with its R&S Mk. III-Fords and won titles in two different series again in 1999.  Elliott Forbes-Robinson won the inaugural American Le Mans Series (ALMS], while Elliott Forbes-Robinson and Butch Leitzinger shared the Grand Am championship and the team won their second Daytona 24 Hour race. The team started the inaugural 1999 ALMS season with a thrilling second-place finish in <ENT>Sebring<ENT> , the closest finish in that race's history.
Irish independence<SEP>In Moore v Attorney-General of the Irish Free State the right of the Oireachtas to abolish appeals to the Privy Council was challenged as a violation of the <ENT>Irish independence<ENT> . The then Attorney General for England and Wales (Sir Thomas Inskip) is reported to have warned the then Attorney-General of the Irish Free State (Conor Maguire) that the Irish Free State had no right to abolish appeals to the Privy Council. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council itself ruled that the Irish Free State Government had that right under the Statute of Westminster 1931 (Imp.).
Isle of Wight<SEP>Born Jessica Stanley Clarke, she was brought up in Chew Magna, Somerset, and learned about the use of herbs from her grandmother, the writer Ruth Lowinsky, and her mother.  At the age of 17, after leaving Cranborne Chase School in Wiltshire, she joined the progressive rock band Marsupilami as a singer and flautist. The band released two albums, appeared at <ENT>Isle of Wight<ENT> and the first Glastonbury Festival, and toured in Europe.   In 1973 she played the role of Jessie, a flautist, in the Doctor Who story 'The Green Death'.

On his final appearance of the season he faced Douvan again in the Herald Champion Novice Hurdle at Punchestown in April and was beaten seven and a half lengths into second by his rival.
Irish Republic<SEP>Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Matthew Nathan, GCMG, PC (Ire) (3 January 1862 – 18 April 1939) was a British soldier and colonial administrator, who variously served as the Governor of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast, Hong Kong, Natal and Queensland. He was Under-Secretary for Ireland from 1914 to 1916, and was responsible, with the Chief Secretary, Augustine Birrell, for the administration of Ireland in the years immediately preceding <ENT>Irish Republic<ENT> .
Taiping<SEP>The newly knighted Bowring received his appointment as Governor of Hong Kong and her Majesty's Plenipotentiary and Chief Superintendent of British Trade in China on 10 January 1854.  He arrived in Hong Kong and was sworn in on 13 April 1854, in the midst of <ENT>Taiping<ENT> occupying the attentions of his primary protagonists and the Crimean War distracting his masters. He was appointed over strong objections from opponents in London.  Fellow Unitarian Harriet Martineau had warned that Bowring was "no fit representative of Government, and no safe guardian of British interests", that he was dangerous and would lead Britain into war with China, and that he should be recalled.  Her pleas went unheeded.
Mons<SEP>The 1st Battalion, Irish Guards deployed to France, eight days after the United Kingdom had declared war upon the German Empire, as part of 4th (Guards) Brigade of the 2nd Division, and would remain on the Western Front for the duration of the war.  The battalion took part in <ENT>Mons<ENT> and the subsequent arduous and bloody Great Retreat. The Irish Guards was part of the rearguard during the retreat and took part in a small-scale action at Landrecies against the advancing Germans. The 1st Irish Guards also took part in another rearguard action at the woods near Villers-Cotterets, on 1 September, during the Battle of Le Cateau in which their Commanding Officer, Lieutenant-Colonel the Hon. George Morris and the Second-in-Command Major Hubert Crichton were killed. Le Cateau was a successful action that inflicted very heavy losses on the Germans and helped delay their advance towards Paris.
Selma<SEP>Wilkins backed a proposal suggested by Dr. T.R.M. Howard of Mound Bayou, Mississippi, who headed the Regional Council of Negro Leadership, a leading civil rights organization in the state. Under the plan, black businesses and voluntary associations shifted their accounts to the black-owned Tri-State Bank of Memphis, Tennessee. By the end of 1955, about $300,000 had been deposited in Tri-State for this purpose. The money enabled Tri-State to extend loans to credit-worthy blacks who were denied loans by white banks. Wilkins participated in the March on Washington (August 1963) which he helped organize. This march was dedicated to the idea of protesting through acts of nonviolence, something that Roy Wilkins was a firm believer in.  Wilkins also participated in <ENT>Selma<ENT> (1965), and the March Against Fear (1966).
Boston<SEP>The 2nd Rhode Island Regiment (also known as Hitchcock's Regiment and the 11th Continental Infantry) was authorized on 6 May 1775 under Colonel Daniel Hitchcock in the Rhode Island Army of Observation and was organized on 8 May 1775 as eight companies of volunteers from Providence County of the colony of Rhode Island. As part of a brigade organized under Nathanael Greene, the unit participated in <ENT>Boston<ENT> during the remainder of 1775. Some elements accompanied Benedict Arnold's expedition to Quebec late in the year. The unit was renamed the 11th Continental Regiment on the first day 1776.
Roswell<SEP>Taken spans five decades and four generations, and centers on three families: the Keys, the Crawfords, and the Clarkes. Nightmares of abduction by extraterrestrials during World War II haunt Russell Keys; <ENT>Roswell<ENT> transforms Owen Crawford from ambitious Air Force captain to amoral shadow government conspirator; and an alien visitor impregnates an unhappily married Sally Clarke. As the decades go by, the heirs of each are affected by the machinations of the aliens, culminating with the birth of Allie Keys, the final product of the aliens' experimentation and the key to their future.
Isle of Wight<SEP>As well as DJing at a variety of events up and down the country, Nihal has DJed <ENT>Isle of Wight<ENT> , Glastonbury Festival and Bestival in the UK. Internationally, he has performed in Bangladesh, Dubai, Germany, India, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, Thailand and toured the U.S. with Bobby Friction and Raghav.
Boston<SEP>Citizens and firefighters alike worked to stop the fire. Along Washington Street, wet blankets and rugs were said to have been used to cover buildings to prevent the fire from spreading to the Old South Meeting House, the church in which <ENT>Boston<ENT> was planned. Some citizens and firefighters climbed to the roof of the meeting house to put out sparks. Most accounts of the fire credit the Kearsarge Engine 3 of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, with saving Old South Meeting House. The efforts to save this historic landmark finally halted the fire at the corner of Washington and Milk Streets, around midday on November 10.
Otumba<SEP>The Montezuma Campaign opens with the Aztecs responding to various prophecies by taking possession of numerous shrines in the jungle, over the opposition of their opponents, the Tlatiluco, the Tepanaca, and the Xochimilco. They then invoke the Triple Alliance of themselves, Texcoco, and Tlacopan in order to defeat the Tlaxcala. Once the Tlaxcala have been defeated, the Texcoco and Tlacopan betray the Aztecs and are promptly defeated themselves. The Spanish then arrive on the shores of the New World in search of gold, and Hernán Cortés destroys his transports to indicate his resolve to make good his claim of the Aztec Empire for Spain. The Aztecs fail to protect the Tabasco from the Spanish and come to the conclusion that the Spanish are their enemies as well as the Tlaxcala and proceed to defeat the Tlaxcala, who have allied with the Spanish, and steal some Spanish horses as well. Montezuma is killed by his own subjects who are fed up with his being out of touch. Cortés builds a Wonder in Tenochtitlán which Cuauhtémoc and a band of raiders eventually destroy, forcing the Spanish out of the city. They then defeat the Tlaxcala and Spanish in <ENT>Otumba<ENT> (a Spanish victory in real life) and capture some horses and gunpowder carts to be able to train cavalry and cannons. They finally defeat the Spanish Army, Spanish Navy, and Tlaxcala from their reclaimed city of Tenochtitlán.
Schengen<SEP>The EU Home Affairs Sub-committee scrutinises policies related to asylum, border security, immigration (including <ENT>Schengen<ENT> ), police cooperation (including Europol), healthcare, and education policy. A top priority of the sub-committee in recent years is an ongoing inquiry in the EU’s response to the European migrant crisis.
Kronstadt<SEP>Born on 25 July 1899 in the village of Pokhorovka in Nizhny Novgorod Governorate, Galanin was drafted into the Red Army in April 1919. He was initially sent to the Simbirsk Reserve Regiment as an ordinary soldier.  Galanin fought on the Eastern Front with the 296th Rifle Regiment, and from December served with the 2nd Brigade of the 25th Rifle Division. He joined the Communist Party in 1920. In April 1920, he transferred to the 38th VOKhR Battalion of the Urals Cheka. In June, Galanin was sent to study at the 2nd Moscow Infantry Courses. He led a cadet section in the suppression of <ENT>Kronstadt<ENT> in March 1921.
Abu Ghraib<SEP>Guantanamo Bay: It is believed that the use of dogs to intimidate prisoners in Iraq was learned from practices at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. The use of dogs on prisoners by regular U.S. forces in Guantanamo Bay Naval Base was prohibited by Donald Rumsfeld in April 2003. A few months later following revelations of abuses at <ENT>Abu Ghraib<ENT> , including use of dogs to terrify naked prisoners; Rumsfeld then issued a further order prohibiting their use by the regular U.S. forces in Iraq.
Cheltenham<SEP>Rite of Passage began his racing career by running in National Hunt flat races or "bumpers". These are races designed to give experience to potential jumpers and are run at National Hunt meetings. Rite of Passage won one of these events, at Galway in August 2008, starting the 9/4 favourite and beating 19 rivals "very easily". Six months later he reappeared at Naas in a similar event and won by six lengths from the odds-on favourite Quadrillon in February before being sent to <ENT>Cheltenham<ENT> for the Grade I Champion Bumper where Pat Smullen replaced the amateur Robbie McNamara as his jockey. The race appeared to lie between Rite of Passage, who was made 5/2 favourite,  and another unbeaten Irish horse Dunguib. Rite of Passage moved up to dispute the lead two furlongs out but looked outpaced in the closing stages and finished third, ten lengths behind Dunguib. On his final "bumper" appearance at the Curragh in May he was made odds-on favourite, but finished fourth.
Lyme<SEP>Babesiosis is a malaria-like parasitic disease caused by infection with Babesia, a type of Apicomplexa. Human babesiosis transmission via tick bite is most common in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States and parts of Europe, and sporadic throughout the rest of the world. It occurs in warm weather.  People can get infected with Babesia parasites by the bite of an infected tick, by getting a blood transfusion from an infected donor of blood products, or by congenital transmission (an infected mother to her baby). Ticks transmit the human strain of babesiosis, so it often presents with other tick-borne illnesses such as <ENT>Lyme<ENT> . After trypanosomes, Babesia is thought to be the second-most common blood parasite of mammals, and they can have a major impact on health of domestic animals in areas without severe winters.  In cattle the disease is known as Texas cattle fever, redwater, or piroplasmosis.
Boston<SEP>Edmund Morgan found that a "Puritan Ethic" was still guiding many of New England's colonists in the 1760s and 1770s. In their nonimportation and nonconsumption rhetoric and in their attacks on luxury and idleness, colonists coalesced around a shared set of American values. Morgan tied <ENT>Boston<ENT> and the Gaspee to the corrupt American Board of Customs Commissioners. Despite all the varieties and differences among the Patriot leadership, Morgan argued that they had a consensus at a more basic, world-view level. A frugal, hard-working, and virtuous people were not going to stand by while Britain imposed a nonproductive class of idle placeholders over them. Dickerson found the "corrupt class" to include some of the "King’s Friends," who personally profited from American ships, merchants, and seafarers through the American Board of Customs, causing irreparable harm to a century of successful Navigation Acts.  Republican virtue, it seemed, would be the guiding principle for America's founders.
Irish independence<SEP>After <ENT>Irish independence<ENT> , it was restored by the Irish Free State government. The results of this reconstruction can still be seen on the building's exterior today – the dome was rebuilt using Irish Ardbraccan limestone which is noticeably darker than the Portland stone used in the original construction.  This was done as an attempt to promote Irish resources.
Irish Republic<SEP>On the eve of the First World War, the Government of Ireland Act 1914 passed into law. The War, however, prevented it from coming into force. <ENT>Irish Republic<ENT> of 1916 and the events that followed it led to the enactment of a fourth Home Rule Bill after the War, known as the Government of Ireland Act 1920. This was heavily influenced by the Unionist leader Sir Edward Carson, and provided six of the nine counties of Ulster with its own devolved parliament independent from that of the rest of the island ("Southern Ireland"). The 1914 Act had provided for a similar partition as a temporary measure, for an unspecified length of time. In the end, only Northern Ireland became a functioning entity, as the Irish War of Independence began in 1919 with nationalist rebels boycotting both Northern and Southern parliaments, preferring their own rebel parliament, however in Northern Ireland, a minority of members (12 out of 52 members of the House of Commons) boycotted the Parliament.
Kronstadt<SEP>Some ships of the fleet took part in the Russian Civil War, notably by clashing with the British navy operating in the Baltic as part of intervention forces. Over the years, however, the relations of the Baltic Fleet sailors with the Bolshevik regime soured, and they eventually rebelled against the Soviet government in <ENT>Kronstadt<ENT> in 1921, but were defeated, and the Fleet de facto ceased to exist as an active military unit.
Daytona<SEP>In 2012, Pastrana competed in <ENT>Daytona<ENT> for AF Waltrip, with NASCAR driver Michael Waltrip, Michael Waltrip Racing owner Rob Kauffman, and road racing veteran Rui Águas as codrivers. After starting 38th, the team's Ferrari 458 finished 35th overall, 22nd in the GT class.

Wakefield<SEP>The Yorkist leaders fled from England after the collapse of their army in the confrontation at Ludford Bridge. The Duke of York took refuge in Ireland, while Edward went with the Nevilles to Calais where Warwick was governor. In 1460 Edward landed in Kent with Salisbury, Warwick and Salisbury's brother William Neville, Lord Fauconberg, raised an army, and occupied London. Edward, Warwick and Fauconberg left Salisbury besieging the Tower of London and advanced against the king, who was with an army in the Midlands, and defeated and captured him in the Battle of Northampton. York returned to England and was declared the king's heir by parliament (in the Act of Accord), but Queen Margaret raised a fresh army against him, and he was killed at <ENT>Wakefield<ENT> on 30 December 1460, along with his second surviving son Edmund, Earl of Rutland, and the Earl of Salisbury.

He finished 13th in that race. He raced there again in 1965, in the MG-Huffaker-Offenhauser, when he finished 14th.
Indianapolis<SEP>Alberto Ascari (Italian pronunciation: [alˈbɛrto ˈaskari]; 13 July 1918 – 26 May 1955) was an Italian racing driver and twice Formula One World Champion. He was a multitalented racer who competed in motorcycle racing before switching to cars. Ascari won consecutive world titles in 1952 and 1953 for Scuderia Ferrari. He was the team's first World Champion and the last Italian to date to win the title. This was sandwiched an appearance in <ENT>Indianapolis<ENT> in 1952. Ascari also won the Mille Miglia in 1954. Ascari was noted for the careful precision and finely-judged accuracy that made him one of the safest drivers in a most dangerous era.
Indian Wells<SEP>His biggest achievement has been winning the 2009 US Open, defeating Rafael Nadal in the semifinal and 5-time defending champion Roger Federer in the final. He was the first to defeat both Federer and Nadal during the same major and was the only man outside the Big Four to win a major between the 2005 French Open and the 2013 US Open, a span of 35 tournaments. He is also the second Argentine and the fifth-youngest man to win the US Open in the Open Era. Other career highlights include reaching the 2018 US Open final, winning the bronze medal in men's singles at the 2012 London Olympics, the silver medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics, <ENT>Indian Wells<ENT> in 2018, and being part of his country's successful Davis Cup team; but his career has also been hampered by a succession of wrist injuries.
Black Oak<SEP>In 1973 the song was covered by southern rock band <ENT>Black Oak<ENT> . It hit #25 on the pop chart and featured Jim Mangrum (who had already been using "Jim Dandy" as a stage name before they covered the song) and female vocalist Ruby Starr trading off vocals. It was the first single from their 1973 album High on the Hog, the band's most commercially successful album.
Kosovo<SEP>The Tornado was operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF), Italian Air Force, and RSAF during the Gulf War of 1991, in which the Tornado conducted many low-altitude penetrating strike missions. The Tornados of various services were also used in conflicts in the former Yugoslavia during the Bosnian War and <ENT>Kosovo<ENT> , the Iraq War, Libya during the Libyan civil war, as well as smaller roles in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Syria. Including all variants, 992 aircraft were built.
Daytona<SEP>In February, 2006 the Gillette company sponsored the "World's Largest Card Stunt" at the <ENT>Daytona<ENT> with over 118,000 fans set to participate. During the singing of the US National Anthem, fans held up cards forming a patriotic design consisting of stars and stripes. Following the anthem, fans flipped the cards to display the "Gillette Fusion" logo.
Abu Ghraib<SEP>During Garland's tenure, the D.C. Circuit has reviewed cases arising from the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. In al Odah v. United States (2003), a panel that included Garland unanimously held that federal courts could not hear challenges from Guantanamo detainees. In Parhat v. Gates (2008), Garland wrote for a unanimous panel that overturned the Combatant Status Review Tribunal's determination that a captured Uyghur was an enemy combatant. In Saleh v. Titan Corp. (2009), Garland dissented from the court's holding that former Iraqi detainees at <ENT>Abu Ghraib<ENT> could not sue private military contractors who participated in torture and prisoner abuse.  Garland wrote that the suit should be allowed to proceed because "no act of Congress and no judicial precedent" immunized the contractors from tort liability, the Federal Tort Claims Act specifically excludes contractors, and tort liability would not interfere with government operations.
Mons<SEP>During the war, the division was involved in the following battles: <ENT>Mons<ENT> , First Battle of the Marne, First Battle of the Aisne, First Battle of Ypres, Battle of Aubers Ridge, Battle of Loos, Battle of the Somme, Battle of Pozières, Third Battle of Ypres, Battle of Épehy.
LM<SEP>Kanaan made his <ENT>LM<ENT> debut at the 2017 edition, replacing the injured Sébastien Bourdais in the #68 Ford Chip Ganassi Team USA Ford GT
Sebring<SEP>He won two F-Production National Championships in 1956 and 1957 with one of the "bathtub" Porsches. Driving a Lister Jaguar, he finished sixth in his class at the <ENT>Sebring<ENT> . After switching to a larger engine in his Porsche in 1963, Underwood won his third F-Production National Championship.
Sebring<SEP>Fish began his career in karts at 13. He then moved to Formula Ford in 1979 at age 18 and then British Formula Three. He then came to the United States and competed in various classes of SCCA competition as well as IMSA GT. He was the 1987 Formula Atlantic champion and then made 14 starts in the Indy Lights series. He returned to sports cars. He was the GTO class winner at <ENT>Sebring<ENT> and 24 Hours of Daytona in 1990.
Lyme<SEP>Normally, the bite mark causes local swelling or welts, but in more serious cases it causes dermatitis. The mite can be infected with a disease called scrub typhus in Asia and the Pacific by carrying saliva directly to the blood stream, but mites in North America have not been known to transmit <ENT>Lyme<ENT> , Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tularemia or any other disease.
Boston<SEP>In the years leading up to the war, the British made the Liberty Tree an object of ridicule. British soldiers tarred and feathered a man named Thomas Ditson, and forced him to march in front of the tree. During <ENT>Boston<ENT> , a party of British soldiers and Loyalists led by Job Williams cut the tree down, knowing what it represented to the patriots, and used it for firewood. (Later, in the Raid on Charlottetown (1775), American privateers would seek revenge against the man who cut the tree down, Loyalist Nathaniel Coffin Jr.)
Kent<SEP>Suzanne Helling has been living a nomadic life since she went through the <ENT>Kent<ENT> , and she winds up in Los Angeles as a teaching assistant to history professor Solomon Braithwaite.  Ten years earlier, his marriage ended, and he tried to kill himself.  While comatose from his drug overdose, his unconscious mind took flight and created the land of Gryylth, which he patterned subconsciously on 5th-century Roman Britain, in a corner of the cosmos.  Though Gryylth bears a superficial similarity to ancient Britain, there are anachronisms: the inhabitants speak modern English; no one remembers more than ten years back; and Gryylth is an incomplete land—it ends in mist and nothingness in the surrounding ocean.
Taiping<SEP>The translation of the Hebrew language part was done mostly by Gutzlaff from the Netherlands Missionary Society, with the exception of the Pentateuch and the book of Joshua, which were done by the group collectively. The initial Gutzlaff translation, completed in 1847 is well known due to its adoption by the revolutionary peasant leader Hong Xiuquan of <ENT>Taiping<ENT> as some of the reputed early doctrines of the organization.
Evening Shade<SEP>Reba and Vince performed the song on the TV series <ENT>Evening Shade<ENT> playing themselves in the episode "Ava Takes A Shower."
Cardis<SEP>The Treaty or Peace of Oliva of 23 April (OS)/3 May (NS) 1660 (Polish: Pokój Oliwski, Swedish: Freden i Oliva, German: Vertrag von Oliva) was one of the peace treaties ending the Second Northern War (1655-1660).The Treaty of Oliva, the Treaty of Copenhagen the same year and <ENT>Cardis<ENT> following year marked the high point of the Swedish Empire.
Irish independence<SEP>Devoy supported the <ENT>Irish independence<ENT> and the formation of the Irish Free State during the Irish Civil War. In 1924 Devoy triumphantly returned to Ireland as an honoured guest of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government of W. T. Cosgrave.
Nürnberg<SEP>The policies of Nazi Germany have been judged after the war by the International Military Tribunal at <ENT>Nürnberg<ENT> and Polish genocide trials to be aimed at extermination of Jews, Poles and Roma, and to have "all the characteristics of genocide in the biological meaning of this term".
Frome<SEP>The British Arts Festivals Association was founded in December 1969 at the behest of Arts Council England to provide expertise on the festival sector. By the early 1980s it became an open membership organisation and now includes amongst its members larger festivals including Edinburgh International Festival and Brighton Festival as well as volunteer run festivals including <ENT>Frome<ENT> and Proms St Judes.
Aughrim<SEP>Burke was a younger son of William Burke, 7th Earl of Clanricarde and succeeded his brother Richard. He was created Baron Bophin (over the isle of Inishbofin where Burke is still a common surname amongst the islanders) in 1689 and commanded a foot regiment as its colonel during the Williamite War in Ireland. He was taken prisoner at <ENT>Aughrim<ENT> in 1691 and outlawed. His younger brother Ulick Burke, 1st Viscount Galway was killed in the same battle. In 1703 he obtained a reversal in return for a fine of twenty-five thousand pounds and the commitment that his two eldest sons would be raised as Protestants, after a private act of the English Parliament.
LM<SEP>TRD is not to be confused with Toyota Motorsport GmbH (TMG), which is located in Cologne, Germany and currently operates Toyota's FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) factory team under the name Toyota Gazoo Racing. Within Toyota, TMG is a completely separate entity from, and therefore not under the control of, TRD. Former TMG activities include operating the Toyota Formula One Team (also known as Panasonic Toyota Racing), which competed in the FIA Formula One World Championship (F1). TMG also competed in the  FIA World Rally Championship (WRC) as Toyota Team Europe with the famous Celica GT-Four and rally versions of the Corolla, and two attempts (in 1998 and 1999) at <ENT>LM<ENT> with the GT-One.
Lyme<SEP>Adult birds may be killed by cats, little owls and sparrowhawks, and eggs and nestlings are taken by magpies, jays, and, where present, grey squirrels. As with other passerine birds, parasites are common, and include endoparasites, such as the nematode Splendidofilaria (Avifilaria) mavis whose specific name mavis derives from this thrush. A Russian study of blood parasites showed that all the Fieldfares, Redwings and Song Thrushes sampled carried haematozoans, particularly Haemoproteus and Trypanosoma. Ixodes ticks are also common, and can carry pathogens, including tick-borne encephalitis in forested areas of central and eastern Europe and Russia, and, more widely, Borrelia bacteria. Some species of Borrelia cause <ENT>Lyme<ENT> , and ground-feeding birds like the song thrush may act as a reservoir for the disease.
Petersburg<SEP>While his brigade fought in <ENT>Petersburg<ENT> , Law was transferred to brigade command in Lt. Gen. Wade Hampton's Cavalry Corps.  It was stationed in South Carolina, where he finished the war. When Maj. Gen. Matthew Butler was wounded at the Battle of Bentonville, Law exercised command of Butler's division until its commander returned to active duty. On March 20, 1865, he was promoted to the rank of Major General; but the promotion was too late to be confirmed by the Confederate Congress.
San Remo<SEP>In March 2002 the group took part in <ENT>San Remo<ENT> with their first song in Italian, "Batte Forte", after which they were highly criticized by the press, above all because of their poor live performance. The single was also included in the re-release of their first album, Popstars Remixed, featuring a second CD with the remixed versions of all their songs, "Batte Forte" included. During the summer of the same year, the group embarked on the Popstars 2002 Tour all over Italy.
Nürnberg<SEP>After World War II, a series of trials were held to hold members of the Nazi party responsible for a multitude of war crimes. The trials were approved by President Harry Truman on May 2, 1945 and were led by the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union. They began on November 20, 1945 in Nuremberg, Germany, in what became known as <ENT>Nürnberg<ENT> . In one of the trials, which became known as the "Doctors' Trial", German physicians responsible for conducting unethical medical procedures on humans during the war were tried. They focused on physicians who conducted inhumane and unethical human experiments in concentration camps, in addition to those who were involved in over 3,500,000 sterilizations of German citizens.
Hubbardton<SEP>The oldest portion of the house is the small rear ell, which was built by Galusha in 1783.  The front part of the house he built in 1805, supposedly to a design by local master builder Lavius Fillmore.  The house was home to Galusha until his death in 1834.  He was a major force in the politics and military of southwestern Vermont for many years, serving in American Revolutionary War at <ENT>Hubbardton<ENT> and the Battle of Bennington.  He was sheriff of Bennington County in the 1780s, and the fifth Governor of Vermont.
Mons<SEP>Born the only son of a farm labourer at Oxbourne Farm in the Kent village of Shoreham, Highgate was himself a farm labourer before enlisting as a regular soldier in 1st Battalion, Royal West Kent Regiment on 4 February 1913, aged 17 years and nine months. Prior to mobilization his battalion was based in Dublin's Richmond Barracks and it crossed to France on 15 August 1914. The battalion first saw action at <ENT>Mons<ENT> , being engaged in both the battle and the subsequent retreat.
Indy<SEP>The company diversified into the automobile business in 1906, producing French Berliet designs under license. Production was located at Alco's Rhode Island Locomotive Works in Providence, Rhode Island. Two years later, the Berliet license was abandoned, and the company began to produce its own designs instead. An Alco racing car won the Vanderbilt Cup in both 1909 and 1910 and competed in the <ENT>Indy<ENT> in 1911, driven on all three occasions by Harry Grant. But, ALCO's automotive venture was unprofitable, and they abandoned automobile manufacture in 1913. The Alco automobile story is notable chiefly as a step in the automotive career of Walter P. Chrysler, who worked as the plant manager. In 1911 he left Alco for Buick in Detroit, Michigan, where he subsequently founded the Chrysler Corporation in 1925.
Hastings<SEP>There is also a scenario editor with which users can develop and share their own battles, and thereby extend the scope of the game. Scenarios as early as <ENT>Hastings<ENT> have been generated this way.
Tarawa<SEP>During the Pacific War, the Imperial Army's reputation for refusing to surrender was established by the few Japanese survivors of numerous battles throughout the Pacific campaign: 921 captured out of a garrison strength of 31,000 in the Battle of Saipan, 17 out of 3000 in <ENT>Tarawa<ENT> , 7,400–10,755 out of 117,000 in the Battle of Okinawa, with a high number of battlefield suicides sanctioned by the Imperial Army. The spirit of gyokusai ("glorious death") saw commanders order suicidal attacks with bayonets, when supplies of hand grenades and ammunition were still available. In the South West Pacific Area (SWPA), just over 1,000 surrendered in each of 1942 and 1943, around 5,100 in 1944, and over 12,000 in 1945, and might have been greater except for disease.  Propaganda through leaflet drops by the Americans accounted for about 20% of surrenders, equating to about one POW for every 6,000 leaflets dropped; while the Japanese objected to the "unscrupulous" leaflets, which contained some truth with regard to the willingness of American forces to accept surrenders from the Japanese. This was in contrast to Imperial Japanese Army's practice of depicting American troops as cruel and merciless, referring to them as 鬼畜米英 (Kichiku Beiei, "Demonic Beast American and English") and informing their own troops that Americans would rape all captured women and torture the men, leading directly to brutal Japanese treatment of POWs in incidents such as the Bataan Death March and the mass suicide of Japanese soldiers and civilians during the battles of Saipan and Okinawa.
Haitian<SEP>It has a wealth of French colonial architecture, which has been well preserved. During and after <ENT>Haitian<ENT> , many craftsmen from Cap‑Haïtien, who were free people of color, fled to French-controlled New Orleans as they were under attack by the mostly African slaves. As a result, the two cities share many similarities in styles of architecture. Especially notable are the gingerbread houses lining the city's older streets.
Lyme<SEP>In July 2015, while Jimmy Fallon was recovering from surgery after suffering a serious injury to his finger, Higgins was hospitalized for <ENT>Lyme<ENT> . He returned to the Tonight Show fully recovered and on the same night as Fallon's return.
Tower Hill<SEP>Convoy PQ 18 sailed from Loch Ewe on 2 September 1942 and arrived at Archangelsk on 12 September. At 15:15 on 13 September, Empire Beaumont was attacked by Heinkel He 111 aircraft of KG26 and torpedoed. Empire Beaumont was still afloat at 16:45 although it was believed that she had sunk by 18:30. Thirty-three survivors were rescued by HMS Sharpshooter. The majority of them were transferred to HMS Scylla and five were landed at Archangelsk for transfer to SS Empire Bard. Those lost on Empire Beaumont are commemorated at <ENT>Tower Hill<ENT> , London.
Stalingrad<SEP>Due to its oil, Grozny with Maikop were the main strategic objectives of the German Fall Blau operation in summer of 1942.  See Battle of the Caucasus.  The failure to take Grozny was a major defeat for Germany and was a factor in holding fast at <ENT>Stalingrad<ENT> , as that city could have served as a base from which to take Grozny or cut off oil supplies up the Volga River from Astrakhan.  The failure to prioritize Grozny, even transferring critical Panzer divisions north to the Siege of Leningrad, was a major factor in Adolf Hitler taking operational level control of the Wehrmacht from his generals who had repeatedly prioritized the two major cities over the oil supplies - against Hitler's express orders.  Soviet doctrine however never failed to prioritize the food of the Ukraine nor the oil of the Caucasus, which resulted in drastic action after Germany's expulsion/retreat in 1943.
Indianapolis<SEP>On January 5, 2005, XM introduced two new XM2go models: Pioneer's AirWare and the Tao from Giant International. On February 28, XM's third satellite, Rhythm, was successful launched. On March 3, XM becomes the exclusive satellite partner of the Indy Racing League and <ENT>Indianapolis<ENT> (IMS Radio Network). On April 11, XM announced that a deal has been reached to be the official satellite radio network of Air America Radio. On May 28, the Wall Street Journal reported that XM had been awarded the contract for the XM 5 spacecraft to Space Systems/Loral. On June 7, XM partnered with Audible.com to offer downloadable audio show archives of The Opie and Anthony Show, as well as The Bob Edwards Show. On August 1, XM announced a three-year partnership with the United States Tennis Association to broadcast the US Open tournament through 2007, as well as weekly reports from other US Open Series events. On September 12, XM announced a 10-year US$100 million deal to carry National Hockey League broadcasts beginning with the 2005–06 season, initially sharing the coverage with SIRIUS but gaining satellite-radio exclusivity from 2007 onward. On November 29, XM launched service in Canada.
Potsdam<SEP>During World War II, the Red Army occupied the town on March 4, 1945. According to an agreement of <ENT>Potsdam<ENT> , after the end of the war the town was put together with Farther Pomerania  under Polish administration. In the context of these post-war boundary changes, Białogard (Belgard) became Polish. Its German population was expelled and the town was populated with Poles, many themselves expellees from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union. Białogard was made a county city in the Szczecin Voivodeship, was later assigned to Koszalin Voivodeship, and is now located in West Pomeranian Voivodeship.
Monterey<SEP>Prior to the album's release Douglas premiered the track "The Frisell Dream" at the <ENT>Monterey<ENT> . The track "Just Say This" refers to the September 11 attacks and their aftermath. Douglas attempts to respond to an eight-year-old's attempt to play Thelonious Monk's "Blue Monk" with the tune "Skeeter-ism". The album's title is derived from a phrase used by Martin Luther King Jr. in reference to America's involvement in the Vietnam War.
Schengen<SEP>In light of the gross misuse of power by the centralized Nazi state, the new  West German constitution provided a strict separation of powers, placing law enforcement firmly in the hands of the states. The only policing agencies allowed at the federal level were the paramilitary Federal Border Guard (German: Bundesgrenzschutz), also responsible for  coast guard services and the Federal Criminal Police, both under the supervision of the Federal Ministry of the Interior. Because Germany's borders became largely open since 2005, due to the development of the European Union and <ENT>Schengen<ENT> to all neighbourhood countries, the Bundesgrenzschutz was renamed to Federal Police (German: Bundespolizei). The duties of the Federal Police still are limited to the security of railway lines, main railway stations, airports, sea ports, and several other special duties.
Kings Mountain<SEP>During the American Revolutionary War, Fort Watauga at Sycamore Shoals (in present-day Elizabethton) was attacked (1776) by Dragging Canoe and his warring faction of Cherokee who were aligned with the British Loyalists. These renegade Cherokee were referred to by settlers as the Chickamauga. They opposed North Carolina's annexation of the Washington District and the concurrent settling of the Transylvania Colony further north and west. The lives of many settlers were spared from the initial warrior attacks through the warnings of Dragging Canoe's cousin, Nancy Ward. The frontier fort on the banks of the Watauga River later served as a 1780 staging area for the Overmountain Men in preparation to trek over the Appalachian Mountains, to engage, and to later defeat the British Army at <ENT>Kings Mountain<ENT> in South Carolina.
Daytona<SEP>Storm's national experience began as the first female host on CNN Sports Tonight from 1989 to 1992. She also hosted Major League Baseball Preview and reported from spring training, the playoffs, and <ENT>Daytona<ENT> . In addition, she hosted the 1990 Goodwill Games for TBS.
Indy<SEP>The 1952 Formula One season was the sixth season of FIA Formula One motor racing. In comparison to previous seasons, the 1952 season consisted of a relatively small number of Formula One races, following the decision to run all the Grand Prix events counting towards the World Championship of Drivers to Formula Two regulations rather than Formula One. <ENT>Indy<ENT> was still run to AAA regulations as in previous seasons.
Leyte<SEP>Paul played on the 1938 state basketball champion team at Carson High School before graduating and attending Santa Clara University. When World War II broke out, Paul joined the U.S. Army and served as a medic, seeing action in <ENT>Leyte<ENT> in the Philippines. After the war, he graduated from the University of Denver (1949) law school.
Kent<SEP>In Season 7, an 18-year-old Glen visits the Francis residence to tell Sally he is being sent to Vietnam and encounters Betty. His revelation that he has enlisted angers Sally, who condemns him for reversing his earlier stance on <ENT>Kent<ENT> . Later, Glen returns to the house and talks to Betty, revealing he flunked out of school and joined the military to appease his stepfather. He tries to seduce Betty, but she reminds him that she is married, and they part on friendly terms.
Dinosaur<SEP>The Echo Park dam would be inside the federally <ENT>Dinosaur<ENT> and would submerge 110 miles (180 km) of scenic canyons – a move that alarmed environmentalists. The environmental organization Sierra Club, led by David Brower, was the most vocal opponent of Echo Park Dam, and fought a protracted battle against the Bureau of Reclamation, on the basis that "building the dam would not only destroy a unique wilderness area, but would set a terrible precedent for exploiting resources in America's national parks and monuments".
Cheltenham<SEP>Our Conor (28 April 2009 – 11 March 2014) was an Irish Thoroughbred racehorse best known for his performances in hurdle racing. As a four-year-old he won the Grade I Spring Juvenile Hurdle and then recorded a fifteen-length win in the Triumph Hurdle at <ENT>Cheltenham<ENT> . A year later he was fatally injured when falling in the Champion Hurdle.
Indianapolis<SEP>In addition to <ENT>Indianapolis<ENT> , the speedway also hosts NASCAR's Brickyard 400 and Indiana 250. From 2000 to 2007, the speedway hosted the Formula One United States Grand Prix, and from 2008 to 2015 the Moto GP.
Glastonbury<SEP>Winehouse promoted the release of Back to Black with headline performances in late 2006, including a Little Noise Sessions charity concert at the Union Chapel in Islington, London. On 31 December 2006, Winehouse appeared on Jools Holland's Annual Hootenanny and performed a cover of Marvin Gaye's "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" along with Paul Weller and Holland's Rhythm and Blues Orchestra. She also performed Toots and the Maytals' "Monkey Man". At his request, actor Bruce Willis introduced Winehouse before her performance of "Rehab" at the 2007 MTV Movie Awards in Universal City, California, on 3 June 2007. During the summer of 2007, she performed at various festivals, including <ENT>Glastonbury<ENT> , Lollapalooza in Chicago, Belgium's Rock Werchter, and Virgin Festival in Baltimore.
Daytona<SEP>Mark Dismore (born October 12, 1956 in Greenfield, Indiana) is a former driver in the Indy Racing League and the 1990 Toyota Pacific champion as well as the winner of the <ENT>Daytona<ENT> with Dan Gurney's All American Racers in a Toyota GTP car with co-drivers Rocky Moran and P. J. Jones. He made 3 CART starts in 1991 but was badly injured in a practice crash for the Indianapolis 500, when his car veered sharply towards the entrance of pit road at the exit of Turn 4 and back-ended the fence, only to careen across the pit lane and smash virtually head on at sizeable speed against the edge of pit wall; this second impact tore off the front of the car leaving Mark's legs exposed. Amongst the injuries he suffered, the most severe was a broken neck. He was largely out of open wheel racing until the 1996 Indy 500 where he drove for Team Menard though he did try to qualify in the 1992 Indianapolis 500 for Concept Motorsports in an outdated Lola/Buick. In 1997 he drove a second car at the Indy 500 for Kelley Racing and would become a full-time fixture there until the 2001 season. He returned to Menard for a partial season in 2002. Dismore has a single IRL win coming in the fall 1999 Texas Motor Speedway race and also finished a career-best third in points that season. Among his 62 career IRL starts he won four poles. He also represented the IRL in the International Race of Champions in 2000 and 2001.
Gettysburg<SEP>In the Confederate States Army, field corps were authorized in November 1862. They were commanded by lieutenant generals and were usually larger than their Union Army counterparts because their divisions contained more brigades, each of which could contain more regiments. All of the Confederate corps at <ENT>Gettysburg<ENT> , for instance, exceeded 20,000 men. However, for both armies, unit sizes varied dramatically with attrition throughout the war. In Civil War usages, by both sides, it was common to write out the number, thus "Twenty-first Army Corps", a practice that is usually ignored in modern histories of the war.
Irish independence<SEP>On the night of 6 June 1921, during <ENT>Irish independence<ENT> , 50 local IRA Volunteers attempted to ambush a party of 40 British troops from Waterford City, who were coming to Tramore following an attack on the RIC barracks there. The ambush took place at Pickardstown, about a mile to the north of Tramore. The ambush failed to go according to plan as they could not  see in the dark field. This caused the death of two IRA men and two wounded. Tramore's Micheál MacCraith GAA Club is named after one of the dead Volunteers.
Tower Hill<SEP>The crew of Empire Amethyst are commemorated on <ENT>Tower Hill<ENT> .
Glastonbury<SEP>In 1999 The Social opened in central London near Oxford Circus, named for the Sunday Social nights which Heavenly ran with The Chemical Brothers during the 90s. The Social is still an independent live venue currently preparing to celebrate its 30th year after fighting off threat of a buyout in 2019. Audiobooks, Black Midi, Goat Girl, Edwyn Collins, The Chemical Brothers and Beck have played at The Social in the past couple of years, and it hosts regular literary readings, often in cahoots with Faber – recent authors include Eimear McBride, Viv Albertine, Deborah Levy, DBC Pierre and Robert Macfarlane. The Social also runs the Stonebridge Bar at <ENT>Glastonbury<ENT> .
Taiping<SEP>Although he was best known in the West for his generally pro-modern stance and importance as a negotiator, Li antagonised the British with his support of Russia as a foil against Japanese expansionism in Manchuria and fell from favour with the Chinese after their defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War. His image in China remains controversial, with criticism on one hand for political and military mistakes and praise on the other for his success against <ENT>Taiping<ENT> , his diplomatic skills defending Chinese interests in the era of unequal treaties, and his role pioneering China's industrial and military modernisation. He was presented the Royal Victorian Order by Queen Victoria. The French newspaper Le Siècle described him as "the yellow Bismarck."
Lyme<SEP>Cat fleas can transmit other parasites and infections to dogs and cats and also to humans. The most prominent of these are Bartonella, murine typhus, and apedermatitis. The tapeworm Dipylidium caninum can be transmitted when an immature flea is swallowed by pets or humans. In addition, cat fleas have been found to carry Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of <ENT>Lyme<ENT> , but their ability to transmit the disease is unclear.
Olympian<SEP>The first time judo was seen in <ENT>Olympian<ENT> was in an informal demonstration hosted by Kano at the 1932 Games. However, Kano was ambivalent about judo's potential inclusion as an Olympic sport:
Hastings<SEP>The site of Kegworth was situated well within the territory of the Coritani (or Corieltauvi), one of the most powerful Ancient British tribes. A date cannot be put on the foundations of the first settlement, although Anglo-Saxon burials have been found in Kingston-on-Soar and at Hathern, a pin from the 7th century was also found near the hermitage which may indicate the date and location of the earliest settlers. The name of Kegworth comes from two languages, Old English and Danish, so it must date from some time between 874 and 1086. It means 'worth' or 'enclosure' of a man named Kaggi, the Danish name for redbeard. However, some sources claim it may mean locked enclosure, from caega "key", an Old English word. It was recorded in the Domesday Book as being held by Earl Harold Godwin, who became the last of the Saxon kings. After Harold's defeat at <ENT>Hastings<ENT> in 1066 the Earl Hugh of Chester was given the land by William the Conqueror. It was known in those days as Cachworde, Caggworth and Cogga.
Hastings<SEP>The most common phenomenon involving the circumflex relates to /s/ before a consonant.  Around the time of <ENT>Hastings<ENT> in 1066, such post-vocalic /s/ sounds had begun to disappear before hard consonants in many words, being replaced by a compensatory elongation of the preceding vowel, which was maintained into the 18th century.
Indy<SEP>In 1964, he sang "Back Home Again in Indiana" before the <ENT>Indy<ENT> car race.
Irish Republic<SEP>The Moore family descends from Sir Garrett Moore, a staunch friend of Hugh O'Neill, the Great Earl of Tyrone, whose submission he facilitated, hosting the negotiations that led to the Treaty of Mellifont in 1603 and ending The Nine Years' War. He represented Dungannon in the Irish House of Commons, and served as President of Munster. In 1616 he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Moore, of Mellefont in the County of Louth. He was further honoured in 1621 when he was made Viscount Moore, of Drogheda, also in the Peerage of Ireland. He was succeeded in 1628 by his son Charles, the second Viscount, who was killed at the Battle of Portlester while fighting for Charles I in the English Civil War. Charles was succeeded by his son Henry, the aforementioned third Viscount, who was raised to an earldom, as Earl of Drogheda, in 1661. The first Earl's younger son Henry, the third Earl (who succeeded his elder brother in 1679), assumed the additional surname of Hamilton upon succeeding to the estates of his brother-in-law, Henry Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Clanbrassil. In a feast of egotism, he built and named Henry Street, Moore Street, Earl Street, Of (or Off) Lane (now Henry Place, and an important escape route for the volunteers fleeing the GPO during <ENT>Irish Republic<ENT> in 1916), and Drogheda Street (part of what is now O'Connell Street).
Irish Republic<SEP>It has often been centre-stage in Irish history, attracting the city's most prominent monuments and public art through the centuries, and formed the backdrop to one of the 1913 Dublin Lockout gatherings, the <ENT>Irish Republic<ENT> , the Irish Civil War of 1922, the destruction of the Nelson Pillar in 1966, and many public celebrations, protests and demonstrations through the years – a role it continues to play to this day. State funeral corteges have often passed the GPO on their way to Glasnevin Cemetery, while today the street is used as the main route of the annual St. Patrick's Day Parade, and as the setting for the 1916 Commemoration every Easter Sunday. It also serves as a major bus route artery through the city centre. The modern tram, the Luas, has undergone an extension and trams now run once again through O'Connell Street. It only travels in one direction, the return loop, to link the system at St. Stephen's Green, runs via Marlborough Street, parallel with and east of O'Connell Street.
Black Oak<SEP>In 1973, Birtha released their second album, Can't Stop the Madness, produced by Christopher Huston. The band continued touring and was on the road for more than 250 days a year, performing with such acts as Fleetwood Mac, Alice Cooper, Poco, <ENT>Black Oak<ENT> , Cheech & Chong, B.B. King, Three Dog Night, James Gang, and more. The band broke up in 1975.
Irish Republic<SEP>Ryan was born in Taghmon, County Wexford, and studied Medicine at University College Dublin. A founder-member of the Irish Volunteers, he saw action during <ENT>Irish Republic<ENT> and War of Independence and was opposed to the Anglo-Irish Treaty. In 1918 Ryan was elected as a Sinn Féin TD for Wexford South, however, he refused to take his seat in the House of Commons at Westminster and instead attended the First Dáil. He was later elected to Wexford County Council.
Nürnberg<SEP>The Katzenberger Trial was a notorious Nazi show trial. A Jewish businessman and leading member of the Nuremberg Jewish community, Lehmann (Leo) Katzenberger, was accused of having an affair with a young "Aryan" woman, and on 14 March 1942 was sentenced to death. The presiding judge at the trial, Oswald Rothaug, was later tried at <ENT>Nürnberg<ENT> (see Judges' Trial) and sentenced to life imprisonment. The Katzenberger Trial later formed the basis of a subplot in the 1961 film Judgment at Nuremberg.
Sebring<SEP>His career was affected by arrests and convictions for driving while intoxicated. Harrington is also one of the few American drivers to compete in the "Big Three" of American motorsports - The Indy 500, The 24 Hours of Daytona, and <ENT>Sebring<ENT> . Harrington also competed in the SVRA celebrity Pro-Am in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. He finished 9th of the 33 starters in 2015 and in 2018 was on the podium with a second place finish in AP.  Harrington is one of the original instructors at the Mid-Ohio school, a position he still holds today.
Taiping Tianguo<SEP>In 1840, a group of four people (Walter Henry Medhurst, Charles Gutzlaff, Elijah Coleman Bridgman, and John Robert Morrison) cooperated to translate the Bible into Chinese. The translation of the Hebrew part was done mostly by Gutzlaff, with the exception that the Pentateuch and the book of Joshua were done by the group collectively. This translation, completed in 1847, is well-known due to its adoption by the revolutionary peasant leader Hong Xiuquan of the Taipingtianguo movement ( <ENT>Taiping Tianguo<ENT> ) as some of the reputed early doctrines of the organization. This Bible translation was a version (in High Wen-li, 深文理) correct and faithful to the original.
Taiping Tianguo<SEP>The monastery reached its peak of influence during the Tang Dynasty (618–907 CE), but was severely damaged during <ENT>Taiping Tianguo<ENT> and was almost destroyed during the Republican period (1912–1949) of Chinese history.
Navarino<SEP>Mahmudiye was a ship of the line of the Ottoman Navy. She was a three-masted three-decked 128-gunned sailing ship, which could perhaps be considered to be one of the few completed heavy-first rate battleships. Mahmudiye, with a roaring lion as the ship's figurehead, was intended to serve to reconstitute the morale of the nation after the loss of the fleet at <ENT>Navarino<ENT> in 1827. The flagship was for many years the largest warship in the world.
LM<SEP>He participated in 38 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 13 May 1950.  He achieved 2 podiums, and scored a total of 18 championship points. He won the Dutch Grand Prix twice in consecutive years between 1950 and 1951, the Circuit d'Albi, Grand-Prix de l'Albigeois and <ENT>LM<ENT> with his son Jean-Louis Rosier. Rosier owned the Renault dealership of Clermont-Ferrand.
Irish Republic<SEP>He was active in <ENT>Irish Republic<ENT> , Irish War of Independence, and the Irish Civil War and was the first Ceann Comhairle (chairman) of Dáil Éireann as well as the first President of Dáil Éireann, the then title of the head of government.
Nürnberg<SEP>Geoffrey Lawrence, 3rd Baron Trevethin, 1st Baron Oaksey, DSO, PC, DL, TD (2 December 1880 – 28 August 1971) was the main British judge during <ENT>Nürnberg<ENT> after World War II, and President of the Judicial group.
Irish Republic<SEP>Perhaps, had Parnell lived, the enactment of "All-Ireland Home Rule" with the consent of all of Ulster and its inclusion in an All-Ireland parliament, could have taken place.  This might have pre-empted the need for Edward Carson, the Ulster leader, backed by the Ulster Covenant and his armed Ulster Volunteers, to force through a separate status for Ulster, as he did in his amending "exclusion of Ulster Bill" to the 1914 Third Home Rule Act, beginning a train of events resulting in the establishment of a Northern Ireland Home Rule Government in Belfast under the Government of Ireland Act 1920.  Had All-Ireland Home Rule evolved earlier, there might perhaps also have been <ENT>Irish Republic<ENT> , no Anglo-Irish War, no independent twenty-six county Free State and no ensuing civil war. However, Murphy argues this to be unlikely because Unionist opposition after 1885 to any form "All-Ireland Home Rule" was extremely resilient and steadfast.
Taiping Tianguo<SEP>Opposition to foot binding had been raised by some Chinese writers in the 18th century. In the mid-19th century, many of the rebel leaders of <ENT>Taiping Tianguo<ENT> were of Hakka background whose women did not bind their feet, and foot binding was outlawed. The rebellion however failed, and Christian missionaries, who had provided education for girls and actively discouraged what they considered a barbaric practice, then played a part in changing elite opinion on footbinding through education, pamphleteering, and lobbying of the Qing court. The earliest-known Western anti-foot binding society, Jie Chan Zu Hui (截纏足会), was formed in Xiamen in 1874. In 1875, 60-70 Christian women in Xiamen led by Alicia Little attended a meeting presided over by a missionary John MacGowan formed the Natural Foot  (tianzu, literally Heavenly Foot) Society. It was then championed by the Woman's Christian Temperance Movement founded in 1883 and advocated by missionaries including Timothy Richard, who thought that Christianity could promote equality between the sexes.
Boston<SEP>Pownall was opposed to Lord North's partial repeal in 1770 of the hated Townshend Acts, in which the tax on tea was retained as a symbol of Parliamentary power.  In debate on the act, Pownall pointed out that retention of the tax would be a "millstone" around English necks rather than a yoke on American ones, and that it would lead to civil war.  His speech was delivered March 5, 1770, the day of <ENT>Boston<ENT> .  Dispirited by his view that Parliament failed to understand the American colonial issues, he urged his colonial correspondents to continue to press constitutional issues and avoid violence.
Daytona<SEP>Brothers Larry and Don Hess raced a Marlin in the <ENT>Daytona<ENT> . Sponsored by Queen City Rambler, a Charlotte, North Carolina AMC dealership, the car ran almost stock, even with a radio antenna. The passenger seats were removed, a roll bar installed, and the factory exhaust system replaced with open headers that exited below the doors. The Marlin retired after 80 laps with overheating and steering problems, and was reportedly sold as a used car after the race.
Kronstadt<SEP>At some point in these revolutions, the "process of transfer of power from Right to Left ceases", and groups even more radical than those in power are suppressed (p. 167). (In France,  the Hébertists are sent to the guillotine (p. 168), in Russia <ENT>Kronstadt<ENT> is crushed.)
Fredericksburg<SEP>Under Harn’s command, the battery served with the Light Division of Col. Hiram Burnham at <ENT>Fredericksburg<ENT> and the Battle of Salem Church. In the artillery brigade of VI Corps, the 3rd New York served at the Battle of Gettysburg. The battery then participated in the Bristoe Campaign, especially at the Battle of Rappahannock Station, and at the Battle of Mine Run.
Iwo Jima<SEP>John Henry "Jack" "Doc" Bradley (July 10, 1923 – January 11, 1994) was a United States Navy Hospital corpsman who was awarded the Navy Cross for extraordinary heroism in combat on February 21, 1945, while assigned to a U.S. Marine Corps rifle company during <ENT>Iwo Jima<ENT> in World War II. Bradley is best known as one of the six men originally identified as those who raised the second of two U.S. flags atop Mount Suribachi, until it was determined in 2016 that he did not.
Daytona<SEP>The final year for the mid-sized Le Mans was 1981 with only base and Grand Le Mans models offered initially.  They were joined mid-year by a new LJ trim level positioned between the base and Grand models.  The car was given a new Firebird-eaque slanted nose which made the 2-door coupe popular in NASCAR, especially as a superspeedway race car in 1981, which was the first year these cars were used in the series. A Le Mans driven by Cale Yarborough won the <ENT>Daytona<ENT> , and one driven by Tim Richmond at the 1983 Pocono 500. Engine offerings by this time included Buick's 231 CID V6, Pontiac's 4.3 L 265 CID V8, Pontiac's 301 CID V8, and Chevrolet's 305 CID V8 (for California only).
Bataan<SEP>George Fleming Moore (July 31, 1887 – December 2, 1949) was a highly decorated officer of the United States Army with the rank of major general. General Moore commanded the Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bays and the Philippine Coast Artillery during <ENT>Bataan<ENT> .
Sebring<SEP>He gave up front line racing following a near-death accident during the <ENT>Sebring<ENT> race, when following a crash his Alfa Romeo Giulia TZ burst into flames. Only the prompt and courageous actions of Jocko Maggiocommo, a fellow driver watching at the trackside who dived into the flames and pulled Sanesi clear, saved his life. Sanesi was paired with driver Roberto Bussinello in the event.
Irish independence<SEP>Breen utterly rejected <ENT>Irish independence<ENT> , which made him, like many others, angry and embittered:
Cortina d'Ampezzo Olympics<SEP>Sapporo, Japan had been the choice for the 1940 Winter Games.  In 1938, the Japanese decided to decline the invitation to host the Games claiming that preparations for the Olympic Games were draining the country's resources.  The IOC turned to the host of the 1936 Games, Garmisch-Partenkirchen, which would make it the only city to host consecutive Games.  This became impractical when Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939; subsequently Germany withdrew its bid to host the Games.  Finland believed it could host the Games and extended an invitation to the IOC, but the Soviet Union's invasion of Finland ended all hope of an Olympic Games in 1940. <ENT>Cortina d'Ampezzo Olympics<ENT> had been awarded to Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy in 1939.  As the war continued, this proved to be impractical and the second consecutive olympiad passed without a celebration of the Games.  The IOC was presented with two possible host cities for the first post-war Games: Lake Placid, United States and St. Moritz, Switzerland.  The IOC decided to award the Games to Switzerland, a neutral country, immediately following World War II, in order to avoid political posturing on the part of former combatants.
Petersburg<SEP>The Benning's Brigade fought at the Battle of Wauhatchie outside Chattanooga, Tennessee, and joined Longstreet's Corps in its unsuccessful Knoxville Campaign in late 1863. Returning to Virginia, the brigade fought against Union Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant in the 1864 Overland Campaign, where Benning was severely wounded in the left shoulder during the Battle of the Wilderness on May 5. This wound kept him out of the remainder of the campaign and much of the <ENT>Petersburg<ENT> , but he was able to return in time for the waning days of that lengthy campaign. His brigade withstood strong Union assaults against its entrenchments, but was forced to withdraw along with the rest of Lee's army in the retreat to Appomattox Court House in early April 1865. Benning, heartbroken, was one of the final officers to lead his men to the surrender ceremony.
Boston<SEP>The Second Continental Congress unanimously elected George Washington to the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army on June 15, 1775. He traveled to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and took command of <ENT>Boston<ENT> on July 3. His headquarters staff initially consisted of his military secretary, Joseph Reed, and one aide-de-camp, Thomas Mifflin.
Lyme<SEP>Still other animals seem to thrive regardless of the maturity of the forest or the presence of the understory. Common animals found in Quehanna include chipmunks, porcupine, and beaver, omnivores such as the black bear and raccoon, and predators like bobcat, red fox, and coyote (which has been in Pennsylvania since the 1930s). Many of the streams in Quehanna Wild Area are known for trout (brook, brown and rainbow); some populations are wild and others are stocked by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission and Mosquito Creek Sportsmen's Association. The wild area is also home to timber rattlesnake, eastern garter snake, and spring peeper (a type of frog), as well as butterflies like great spangled fritillary, monarch, red-spotted purple, and black, eastern tiger, and spicebush swallowtails. Any of these mammals, especially the white-tailed deer, can carry ticks, and such tick-borne diseases as <ENT>Lyme<ENT> are a health concern for hikers.
Glastonbury<SEP>After headlining the <ENT>Glastonbury<ENT> , Coldplay returned to the studio and worked on some tracks from the "Songs for #3" CD they had produced earlier. Phil Harvey, the band's manager, heard "Clocks" and urged them to rework it immediately: "No, you must do that song now 'cause you're going on [in the lyrics] about urgency, and you're talking about keeping this song back. That doesn't make sense."
Le Mans<SEP>The Mazda 727C is a prototype racing car that was built for Mazdaspeed for <ENT>Le Mans<ENT> in the Group C2 class. It replaced the 717C in 1984 as an evolution of the Mooncraft-built design, and used the same 2-rotor 13B Wankel engine as the previous model.
Indianapolis<SEP>The Monaco Grand Prix (French: Grand Prix de Monaco) is a Formula One motor race held annually on the Circuit de Monaco on the last weekend in May. Run since 1929, it is widely considered to be one of the most important and prestigious automobile races in the world, and is one of the races - along with <ENT>Indianapolis<ENT> and the 24 Hours of Le Mans - which forms the Triple Crown of Motorsport. The circuit has been called "an exceptional location of glamour and prestige".
Mons<SEP>On 18 August, General Albert d'Amade formed a defence line from Maubeuge to Dunkirk, to prevent the disruption of railways by German cavalry raids. The Scarpe, Escaut and Rhonelle sluices were opened to extend the floods of the Scarpe and the old forts of de Maulde, Flines, Curgies, Condé and Le Quesnoy around Valenciennes were re-occupied. On 20 August, d'Amade formed a line of three territorial divisions de campagne, with the 84th Territorial Division from the Scarpe to the Sambre, the 82nd Territorial Division from the Sambre to the Lys and the 81st Territorial Division from the Lys to the sea. When the BEF advanced to the west of Maubeuge, the 84th Territorial Division advanced to Condé and formed a new defensive line along the Escaut, from Condé to Maulde. On 23 August, the 88th Territorial Division arrived near Lille from Paris, with orders to recapture Tournai. The division was bombarded by heavy artillery when close to Cysoing the next morning and slowly retired to Templeuve and Arras. After the Battle of Charleroi (21 August) and <ENT>Mons<ENT> (23 August), Amiens became vulnerable to the advance of the 1st Army as it pursued the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and the Fifth Army. At 2:00 a.m. on 24 August, the Siege of Maubeuge began and the 84th Territorial Division fell back towards Cambrai and Marquion. The rearguard was attacked near Fresnes, just south of Condé and next day, the division was engaged near Haspres and defeated.
Taiping<SEP>The house is elaborately finished with the extensive use of stained glass. Booloominbah contains more stained glass than any other house designed by Hunt, including "Kirkham" and indicates a particular aesthetic of Frederick and Sarah White. All the main reception rooms have stained glass, as does the day nursery. The main stair hall is dominated by a huge window celebrating the life of the martyr of Khartoum, General Charles George Gordon. This, by the English firm of Lavers, Barraud and Westlake, is the largest such window in a domestic setting in Australia. General Gordon distinguished himself during the Crimean War and the siege of Sevastopol and then again during <ENT>Taiping<ENT> in China. At the end of his service in China, Gordon returned to England and worked on defending the Thames at Gravesend. While there, he became interested in the plight of the working-class boys in the area and established a ragged school, as well as implementing other initiatives to improve their lives.
Boston<SEP>After <ENT>Boston<ENT> (March 5, 1770) he and John Adams defended Captain Preston and the accused soldiers and secured their acquittal. Prosecuting the case were Robert Treat Paine and Josiah's older brother Samuel Quincy, who shortly after was named solicitor general.
Indianapolis<SEP>He started from the pole position driving a Maserati in the <ENT>Indianapolis<ENT> , but spark plug problems put him out of the race after sixty laps. He then took over the Wetteroth/Offenhauser car being driven by Floyd Davis that had started in 17th place. Rose went on to win. In 1947 and 1948, Rose captured back-to-back Indy 500's driving one of the Deidt/Offenhauser Blue Crown Spark Plug Specials, owned and prepared by veteran driver/car owner Lou Moore.
Nürnberg<SEP>After the war, Jodl was indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit crimes against peace; planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression; war crimes; and crimes against humanity at the Allied- <ENT>Nürnberg<ENT> . The principal charges against him related to his signature of the criminal Commando and Commissar Orders. Found guilty on all charges, he was sentenced to death and executed in Nuremberg in 1946.
Daytona<SEP>Waltrip drove the No. 48 P. B. Crowell owned Ford sponsored by American Home, in Nashville, where he aggressively promoted the week's race when he appeared on a local television program promoting the speedway's races, and was not afraid to embrace the local media when other competitors were reluctant to do so. Some of the notorious "on air" trash-talking included making fun of some of the other local drivers such as Coo Coo Marlin (whose son Sterling later raced at the circuit and is a two-time <ENT>Daytona<ENT> winner) and James "Flookie" Buford, whose nickname he would mock on air. It pleased track management that he was helping sell tickets, leading to packed grandstands and extra paychecks from track operators for his promotional skills.
Mons<SEP>Following the outbreak of the First World War, 1st Battalion, The Irish Guards was deployed to France almost immediately, and they remained on the Western Front for the duration of the war. During the early part of the war, the battalion took part in <ENT>Mons<ENT> and formed the Allied rearguard during the Great Retreat. The battalion then took part in one of the bloodiest battles of 1914, the First Battle of Ypres, which began on 19 October, which left major casualties among the old Regular Army.
Hastings<SEP>To the west of the village is Standard Hill, said to be the place that William the Conqueror placed his flag after <ENT>Hastings<ENT> . As with many other Wealden villages, it was involved in the iron industry: that fact is commemorated by the presence in the village of a set of iron stocks. Smuggling was also rife in the eighteenth century.
Navarino<SEP>However, as Greece became embroiled in a civil war, the Sultan called upon his strongest subject, Muhammad Ali of Egypt, for aid. Plagued by internal strife and financial difficulties in keeping the fleet in constant readiness, the Greeks failed to prevent the capture and destruction of Kasos and Psara in 1824, or the landing of the Egyptian army at Modon despite victories at Samos and Gerontas. The Revolution was threatened with collapse until the intervention of the Great Powers in <ENT>Navarino<ENT> in 1827. There the Egypto-Ottoman fleet was decisively defeated by the combined fleets of the Britain, France and the Russian Empire, effectively securing the independence of Greece.
Olympian<SEP>Since 2000, Taekwondo has been one of only two Asian martial arts (the other being judo) that are included in <ENT>Olympian<ENT> . It started as a demonstration event at the 1988 games in Seoul, a year after becoming a medal event at the Pan Am Games, and became an official medal event at the 2000 games in Sydney. In 2010, Taekwondo was accepted as a Commonwealth Games sport.
Schengen<SEP>Another issue is using standardized technology for communication with agencies in other countries. Norway is a member of <ENT>Schengen<ENT> , which requires trans-border communication between law enforcement agencies. There were 27 different networks for the police, one for each police district. In Oslo, Akershus and Østfold, the police had also been using Enhanced Digital Access Communication System since 1994. There were 230 municipal fire department radio systems, and a manual mobile phone system for the health sector. The health network was built by the county municipalities between 1990 and 1995 and covers all parts of the health service, including paramedics, ambulance services, midwives and medical doctors. The various systems had different levels of coverage. In addition, Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) and Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT450) telephones were being used where encrypted communication was necessary.
Daytona<SEP>John is the son of Aldo (Mario's twin brother) so he is Michael and Jeff's cousin. He has had a long and successful career in several forms of motorsport, including wins in NASCAR, CART, and <ENT>Daytona<ENT> . He has also competed in NHRA drag racing, and has worked in radio broadcasting. The majority of his career was spent in NASCAR.
Gettysburg<SEP>Reid also served as Rector of the University of Glasgow, elected in 1971, largely on the back of his union activities. When installed as Rector, he gave a critically acclaimed speech, which became known as "the rat-race speech". The New York Times printed the speech in full and described it as "the greatest speech since President Lincoln's <ENT>Gettysburg<ENT> ".
LM<SEP>Behra was small in stature, stocky, and weighed 178 pounds. Behra had big shoulders and was scarred from 12 crashes. In 1955 he had an ear torn off from a collision. He sometimes drove magnificently, while at other times he drove with a lack of enthusiasm.  Behra was known for being hard-charging and temperamental, which led to confrontations with Ferrari team managers after being accused of overstressing engines at <ENT>LM<ENT> and the Reims Grand Prix race in 1959.  He was dismissed from the Ferrari team after assaulting a team manager, shortly before his death.
Kent<SEP>College enrollment reached 9 million by the end of the 1960s. Colleges and universities in America had more students than ever before, and these institutions often tried to restrict student behavior to maintain order on the campuses. To combat this, many college students became active in causes that promoted free speech, student input in the curriculum, and an end to archaic social restrictions. Students joined the antiwar movement because they did not want to fight in a foreign civil war that they believed did not concern them or because they were morally opposed to all war. Others disliked the war because it diverted funds and attention away from problems in the U.S. Intellectual growth and gaining a liberal perspective at college caused many students to become active in the antiwar movement. Another attractive feature of the opposition movement was the fact that it was a popular social event.  Most student antiwar organizations were locally or campus-based because they were easier to organize and participate in than national groups. Common antiwar demonstrations for college students featured attempts to sever ties between the war machine and universities through burning draft cards, protesting universities furnishing grades to draft boards, and protesting military and Dow Chemical job fairs on campus. From 1969 to 1970, student protesters attacked 197 ROTC buildings on college campuses. Protests grew after <ENT>Kent<ENT> , radicalizing more and more students. Although the media often portrayed the student antiwar movement as aggressive and widespread, only 10% of the 2500 colleges in the United States had violent protests throughout the Vietnam War years. By the early 1970s, most student protest movements died down due to President Nixon's de-escalation of the war, the economic downturn, and disillusionment with the powerlessness of the antiwar movement.
Hastings<SEP>Between 1962 and 2000 Gentleman designed 103 stamps for the Post Office, making him the most prolific stamp designer in Britain at that time. These include sets for Shakespeare, Churchill, Darwin, British Ships, Concorde, the Battle of Britain, <ENT>Hastings<ENT> , the BBC, Good King Wenceslas, The Twelve Days of Christmas, Social Reformers, Ely Cathedral, Abbotsbury Swannery and the Millennium.
Nürnberg<SEP>Despite poor health, Funk was tried with other Nazi leaders at <ENT>Nürnberg<ENT> . Accused of conspiracy to commit crimes against peace; planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression; war crimes and crimes against humanity, he argued that, despite his titles, he had very little power in the regime. He did however, admit to signing the laws that "aryanized" Jewish property. He claimed to be "morally guilty".  At the Nuremberg trials American Chief Prosecutor Robert Jackson labeled Funk as "The Banker of Gold Teeth", referring to the practice of extracting gold teeth from Nazi concentration camp victims, and forwarding the teeth to the Reichsbank for melting down to yield bullion. Many other gold items were stolen from victims, such as jewellery, eyeglasses and finger rings.  Funk cried during presentation of evidence and needed sleeping pills at night. Göring described Funk as "an insignificant subordinate," but documentary evidence and his wartime biography Walther Funk, A Life for Economy were used against him during the trial, leading to his conviction on counts 2, 3 and 4 of the indictment and his sentence of life imprisonment.
Kronstad<SEP>Arguing that the revolution needed not a mere parliamentary organization but a party of action which would function as a scientific body of direction, a vanguard of activists, and a central control organ, the Tenth Party Congress banned factions within the party, initially intending it only to be a temporary measure after the shock of <ENT>Kronstad<ENT> . It was also argued that the party should be an elite body of professional revolutionaries dedicating their lives to the cause and carrying out their decisions with iron discipline, thus moving toward putting loyal party activists in charge of new and old political institutions, army units, factories, hospitals, universities, and food suppliers. Against this backdrop, the nomenklatura system would evolve and become standard practice.
Nürnberg<SEP>Generalfeldmarschall von Blomberg and his wife subsequently went on a honeymoon for a year to the island of Capri. Admiral Erich Raeder decided that Blomberg needed to commit suicide in order to atone for his marriage, and dispatched an officer to Italy, who followed the Blombergs around on their honeymoon, persistently and unsuccessfully trying to force Blomberg to commit suicide. The officer at one point even tried to force a gun into Blomberg's hands; but he declined to end his life. Spending World War II in obscurity, Blomberg was arrested by the Allies in 1945. Later he gave evidence at <ENT>Nürnberg<ENT> .
Monaco<SEP>Some major races, such as the Singapore Grand Prix, <ENT>Monaco<ENT> (sanctioned by Formula One) and the Long Beach Grand Prix (sanctioned by IndyCar), are held on temporary street circuits. However, most open-wheel races are on dedicated road courses, such as Watkins Glen International in the US, Nürburgring in Germany, Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium and Silverstone in Great Britain. In the United States some top-level open-wheel events are held on ovals, of both short track and superspeedway variety, with an emphasis being placed more on speed and endurance than the maneuverability inherently required by road and street course events. The Whelen Modified Tour is the only opened wheeled race car series endorsed by NASCAR. This series races on most of NASCAR's most famous tracks in the United States. Other asphalt modified series race on short tracks in the United States and Canada, such as Wyoming County International Speedway in New York. The most well-attended oval race in the world is the annual Indianapolis 500 (Indy 500) in Speedway, Indiana, sanctioned by IndyCar; in the United States, it is quite common to refer to open-wheel cars as IndyCars, or Champ Cars, because of their recognizable appearance and widespread popularity across America at the Indy 500.
Daytona<SEP>Bodine, however, was injured in the season opening Craftsman Truck Series race of 2000, and Bessey was sent scrambling for a driver. The team missed <ENT>Daytona<ENT> , but Bessey's new driver, Ted Musgrave made the next five races. After a best finish of 16th, Musgrave left and Bessey moved onto Dick Trickle, who made three starts for Bessey, before Bodine returned to the team at Richmond. Bodine had a solid run of 13th in his return, but the team continued to struggle to qualify. Bodine only made 10 of the next 14 races. Even with a best finish of 12th, Bessey released Bodine after a 41st at Richmond.
Irish independence<SEP>The Irish Republic claimed jurisdiction over the whole island of Ireland. The declaration made no mention of the independence of the 32-county geographic island, just the independence of the "Irish nation" or "Irish people". It was rivalled by the British administration of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, but as <ENT>Irish independence<ENT> went on, it increased its legitimacy in the eyes of most Irish people. It was taken over by the Irish Free State in 1922, after the Anglo-Irish Treaty.
Nürnberg<SEP>Meanwhile, Alfried was held in Landsberg prison, where Hitler had been imprisoned in 1924. At the Krupp Trial, held in 1947–1948 in Nuremberg following the <ENT>Nürnberg<ENT> , Alfried and most of his co-defendants were convicted of crimes against humanity (plunder and slave labor), while being acquitted of crimes against peace, and conspiracy. Alfried was condemned to 12 years in prison and the "forfeiture of all [his] property both real and personal," making him a pauper. Two years later, on 31 January 1951, John J. McCloy, High Commissioner of the American zone of occupation, issued an amnesty to the Krupp defendants. Much of Alfried's industrial empire was restored, but he was forced to transfer some of his fortune to his siblings, and he renounced arms manufacturing.
Daytona<SEP>Following the <ENT>Daytona<ENT> , months after his fatal plane crash, IMSA retired Al Holbert's #14.
Taiping Tianguo<SEP>The Nian Rebellion (Chinese: 捻亂; pinyin: Niǎn Luàn) was an armed uprising that took place in northern China from 1851 to 1868, contemporaneously with <ENT>Taiping Tianguo<ENT> (1851–1864) in South China. The rebellion failed to topple the Qing dynasty, but caused immense economic devastation and loss of life that became major long-term factors in the collapse of the Qing regime in the early 20th century.
Cheltenham<SEP>Cole Harden made his debut over hurdles at Fontwell Racecourse on 23 October 2013 when he started at odds of 4/1 and finished fourth behind Shantou Magic. In November at the same course he recorded his first win over obstacles when starting 9/4 favourite and winning by four lengths from Westaway. In January, Cole Harden followed up his previous success when winning a novice hurdle at Newbury Racecourse, beating Full Shift by eight lengths after leading from the start. On his next appearance Cole Harden finished second to Un Temps Pour Tout at Ascot Racecourse in February. In March Cole Harden was sent to <ENT>Cheltenham<ENT> for the first time and contested the Baring Bingham Novices' Hurdle over two miles and five furlongs. Starting a 40/1 outsider he led until the third last flight but faded in the closing stages and finished seventh behind Faugheen. On his final appearance of the season, Cole Harden was moved up in distance for the Sefton Novices' Hurdle at Aintree Racecourse in April and finished second of the eighteen runners, four lengths behind the Nicky Henderson-trained Beat That.
Abu Ghraib<SEP>After the US-led 2003 invasion of Iraq, al-Bilawi joined al-Qaida in Iraq and worked closely with its then-leader, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Najm al-Bilawi was detained by American forces in 2005 in Camp Bucca. Al-Bilawi was one of the approximately 500 prisoners who escaped from <ENT>Abu Ghraib<ENT> in July 2013, following a raid and mass jailbreak by members of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.
Lyme<SEP>Ixodes scapularis is commonly known as the deer tick or black-legged tick (although some people reserve the latter term for Ixodes pacificus, which is found on the west coast of the USA), and in some parts of the US as the bear tick. It is a hard-bodied tick (family Ixodidae) of the eastern and northern Midwestern United States and southeastern Canada. It is a vector for several diseases of animals, including humans ( <ENT>Lyme<ENT> , babesiosis, anaplasmosis, Powassan virus disease, etc.) and is known as the deer tick owing to its habit of parasitizing the white-tailed deer. It is also known to parasitize mice, lizards, migratory birds, etc. especially while the tick is in the larval or nymphal stage.
Irish independence<SEP>The Irish Republican Army (IRA) (Irish: Óglaigh na hÉireann) was an Irish republican revolutionary paramilitary organisation. The ancestor of many groups also known as the Irish Republican Army, and distinguished from them as the Old IRA, it was descended from the Irish Volunteers, an organisation established on 25 November 1913 that staged the Easter Rising in April 1916. In 1919, the Irish Republic that had been proclaimed during the Easter Rising was formally established by an elected assembly (Dáil Éireann), and the Irish Volunteers were recognised by Dáil Éireann as its legitimate army. Thereafter, the IRA waged a guerrilla campaign against the British occupation of Ireland in the <ENT>Irish independence<ENT> .
Olympian<SEP>Amateur boxing may be found at the collegiate level, at <ENT>Olympian<ENT> and Commonwealth Games, and in many other venues sanctioned by amateur boxing associations. Amateur boxing has a point scoring system that measures the number of clean blows landed rather than physical damage. Bouts consist of three rounds of three minutes in the Olympic and Commonwealth Games, and three rounds of three minutes in a national ABA (Amateur Boxing Association) bout, each with a one-minute interval between rounds.
Kronstadt<SEP>In the first year of World War I, Andrei Pervozvanny and Imperator Pavel I formed the core of the Baltic Fleet. For most of the war they remained moored in the safety of Sveaborg and Helsingfors. Idle, demoralized ratings subscribed to Bolshevik ideology and on March 16 [O.S. March 3] 1917 took control of the ships in a violent mutiny, killing many of their officers in the process. The battleships participated in the Ice Cruise of 1918, and Andrei Pervozvanny later helped to put down the Krasnaya Gorka fort mutiny of 1919. After <ENT>Kronstadt<ENT> of 1921, the Bolshevik government lost interest in maintaining the battleships, and they were scrapped beginning in November–December 1923.
Monaco<SEP>McLaren founded Bruce McLaren Motor Racing in 1963. A year later, the company built the first McLaren race car – the M1A; 24 were produced. Its successor, the M1B, allowed McLaren into the Can-Am championship and emerged the dominant victor with 43 victories, almost three times more than rival Porsche. In 1965, the first McLaren Formula One car, the M2B, debuted at <ENT>Monaco<ENT> .
Abu Ghraib<SEP>Bazoft was arrested at Baghdad airport in September 1989, while waiting for his flight back to London. He had 34 photographs of the area of al-Hilla in his luggage, and some soil from near the factory. After six weeks in custody at <ENT>Abu Ghraib<ENT> , and after beatings, Bazoft was put in front of TV cameras on 1 November and confessed to being an Israeli agent. Parish had also been arrested by Iraqi authorities.  Before their trial, President Saddam Hussein wrote to British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, assuring her that Bazoft and Parish would get a fair trial.
Lyme<SEP>Ogden Dunes has been reported as having the highest rate of <ENT>Lyme<ENT> in Indiana.
Darfur<SEP>From the late 1990s to the early 2000s, international interventions authorized by the UN took a wider variety of forms. The UN mission in the Sierra Leone Civil War of 1991–2002 was supplemented by British Royal Marines, and the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 was overseen by NATO. In 2003, the United States invaded Iraq despite failing to pass a UN Security Council resolution for authorization, prompting a new round of questioning of the organization's effectiveness. Under the eighth Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, the UN intervened with peacekeepers in crises such as <ENT>Darfur<ENT> in Sudan and the Kivu conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo and sent observers and chemical weapons inspectors to the Syrian Civil War. In 2013, an internal review of UN actions in the final battles of the Sri Lankan Civil War in 2009 concluded that the organization had suffered "systemic failure". In 2010, the organization suffered the worst loss of life in its history, when 101 personnel died in the Haiti earthquake
Mons<SEP>On the outbreak of the First World War, Holmes' regiment was part of the British Expeditionary Force sent to France. He saw action in <ENT>Mons<ENT> and at the First Battle of Ypres. After suffering frostbite in the winter of 1914, he was medically evacuated to England for treatment; this saw two toes being amputated.
Irish independence<SEP>During the War of Independence, Boland commanded the Third Battalion, No. 2 (South Dublin) Brigade of the IRA and was known as 'Trotsky' for his left-wing views. He and his brothers were opposed to <ENT>Irish independence<ENT> of 1921, though Gerald spent most of the Irish Civil War in prison.
Taiping Tianguo<SEP>The Xianfeng Emperor (17 July 1831 – 22 August 1861), personal name Yizhu, was the ninth Emperor of the Qing dynasty, and the seventh Qing emperor to rule over China proper, reigned from 1850 to 1861. During his reign the Qing dynasty experienced several wars and rebellions including <ENT>Taiping Tianguo<ENT> , Nian Rebellion, and Second Opium War (Arrow War).
Irish Republic<SEP>Michael O'Hanrahan (Irish: Micheál Ó hAnnrachain; 16 January 1877 – 4 May 1916) was an Irish rebel who was executed for his active role in the <ENT>Irish Republic<ENT> .
Taiping Tianguo<SEP>The US, at the same time, wanting to protect its interests and expand trade, ventured the USS Wachusett six hundred miles up the river to Hankow sometime in the 1860s, while the USS Ashuelot, a sidewheeler, made her way up the river to Yichang in 1874. The first USS Monocacy, a sidewheel gunboat, began charting the Yangtze River in 1871. The first USS Palos, an armed tug, was on Asiatic Station into 1891, cruising the Chinese and Japanese coasts, visiting the open treaty ports and making occasional voyages up the Yangtze River. From June to September 1891, anti-foreign riots up the Yangtze forced the warship to make an extended voyage as far as Hankou, 600 miles upriver. Stopping at each open treaty port, the gunboat cooperated with naval vessels of other nations and repairing damage. She then operated along the north and central China coast and on the lower Yangtze until June 1892. The cessation of bloodshed with <ENT>Taiping Tianguo<ENT> , Europeans put more steamers on the river. The French engaged the Chinese in war over the rule of Vietnam. The Sino-French Wars of the 1880s emerged with the Battle of Shipu having French cruisers in the lower Yangtze.
Fredericksburg<SEP>Over the winter of 1862–63, Sigel commanded the XI Corps, consisting primarily of German immigrant soldiers, in the Army of the Potomac. During this period, the corps saw no action; it stayed in reserve during <ENT>Fredericksburg<ENT> . Sigel had developed a reputation as an inept general, but his ability to recruit and motivate German immigrants kept him employed in a politically sensitive position. Many of these soldiers could speak little English beyond "I'm going to fight mit Sigel", which was their proud slogan and which became one of the favorite songs of the war.
Daytona<SEP>He raced in the <ENT>Daytona<ENT> , but has primarily raced in the FIA GT Championship, mostly in Ferrari cars. He has taken two class wins and four further class podiums. In 2006 he has occasionally raced alongside Jarek Janis and Sascha Bert in a Saleen ran by the Zakspeed team. In 2007 he won the International GT Open's GTA class, driving a Ferrari 430 for Scuderia Playteam alongside co-champion Michele Maceratesi, the duo becoming overall champions the following season. He won a second overall championship title in 2013.
San Remo<SEP>Before the release of Ray of Light, Madonna appeared on several television shows and events to promote the album, and would sometimes perform the song. Madonna first performed "Frozen" on <ENT>San Remo<ENT> on January 24, 1998. The following month, on February 21, she performed the song on the BBC 1's The National Lottery Show. Additionally, that same month, she appeared and performed the song on the German TV show Wetten, dass..?. On April 29, 1998, Madonna made an unannounced appearance at the 9th annual Rainforest Foundation Benefit Concert at New York City's Carnegie Hall, where she performed "Frozen" with the East Harlem Violin Project, while wearing a Versace dress. Jon Pareles from The New York Times felt that during this performance Madonna had "turned herself into America's answer to Björk". Later that occasion, she wore a cowboy hat and joined various artists in a rendition of The Beatles' "With A Little Help From My Friends" and "Twist & Shout".
Talavera<SEP>Cotton was elected Member of Parliament for Newark in 1806. He was deployed to Portugal in April 1809 and commanded a cavalry brigade in Sir Arthur Wellesley's Army. Cotton was both courageous and also splendidly dressed in battle throughout the Peninsular War and was nicknamed the "Lion d' Or" ("Lion of Gold"). He took part in the Second Battle of Porto in May 1809 and <ENT>Talavera<ENT> in July 1809 and, having succeeded to his father's baronetcy in August 1809, returned home to view his estate. He returned to Portugal in May 1810 and, having been promoted to the local rank of lieutenant general and given overall command of the cavalry, fought at the Battle of Bussaco in September 1810 and then covered the withdrawal to the Lines of Torres Vedras later that year.
Irish independence<SEP>On 2 August 1920, during <ENT>Irish independence<ENT> , the Irish Republican Army (IRA) ambushed a British Army lorry on the Claremorris road from Ballyhaunis, seizing weapons and ammunition. A high cross marks the spot of the ambush. On 1 April 1921, Sean Corcoran, O/C of the IRA's East Mayo Brigade, was shot dead by British soldiers after a short gunfight at Crossard crossroads (6 km north of Ballyhaunis). A high cross marks the spot where Corcoran died. Later that same day, a member of the British Black and Tans was killed by a sniper. In retaliation, the Black and Tans executed Michael Coen, a man who was later believed not to have taken part in fighting of any kind. A monument to Coen was placed on the Cloonfad/Galway road from Ballyhaunis.
Kronstadt<SEP>Mikhail Dratvin was born on 21 November 1897, in the village of Ekimovo, Galichsky District, Kostroma Oblast of the Russian Empire. In 1911, he graduated from a vocational school and subsequently worked in a Saint Petersburg telegraph company. In 1914, he acquired a telegraphist diploma. In 1916, he was drafted into the Russian army and fought in World War I as a functionary of the post–telegraph service. In 1918, he enlisted into the Red Army fighting in various campaigns of the Russian Civil War, including the suppression of <ENT>Kronstadt<ENT> . At the conclusion of the war he was transferred into the intelligence branch of the army.
Indianapolis<SEP>In 2009 and 2010, GoDaddy advertised during <ENT>Indianapolis<ENT> .
Abu Ghraib<SEP>Following the period of combat in March–April 2003, both protests and armed combat experienced a temporary decline in intensity. Protests against the war as a whole continued, often on the occasion of anniversaries of the war and visits by members of the Bush administration to foreign cities. Within the United States, general anti-war protests were joined by protests focusing on particular issues or strategies including: opposition to torture and abuse (such as that in <ENT>Abu Ghraib<ENT> ), calls for withdrawal of members of the coalition from Iraq, counter-recruitment, support for military resisters such as Lt. Ehren Watada, and opposition to military and corporate contractors. The largest protests during this period have been national, multi-issue mobilizations such as those on August 30, 2004, and April 29, 2006. Black bloc elements were present during some of the protests.
Kosovo<SEP>During the end of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st centuries, the conflicts in the Balkans and <ENT>Kosovo<ENT> set in motion large population movements of Albanians to Central, Western and Northern Europe. The gradual collapse of communism in Albania triggered as well a new wave of migration and contributed to the emergence of a new diaspora, mainly in Southern Europe, in such countries as Greece and Italy.
Kronstad<SEP>Anarchists enthusiastically participated in the Russian Revolution. During the revolution, anarchists had concerns, but they opted to support the revolution instead of the Whites. However, they met harsh suppression after the Bolshevik government was stabilized. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. Anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow instead fled to Ukraine. <ENT>Kronstad<ENT> and Nestor Makhno's struggle in the Free Territory were the most notable examples. With the anarchists being crashed in Russia, two new antithetical currents emerged, namely platformism and synthesis anarchism. Platformists sought to create a coherent group that would push for the revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble a political party. The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw the Bolshevik success as setting an example and communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, members of the major syndicalist movements of the General Confederation of Labour and Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) left the organisations and joined the Communist International.
Lyme<SEP>Jorge Benach is a medical researcher at the Stony Brook University in New York state.  Benach is the chair of the Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology.  Benach's main area of research is the tick-borne spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi which is the causative agent of <ENT>Lyme<ENT> .
Fredericksburg<SEP>The 20th Maine first engaged in combat in the Battle of Shepherdstown Ford; the end of the Maryland Campaign. During <ENT>Fredericksburg<ENT> , Melcher was promoted to Sergeant-Major for "meritorious conduct", by Col. Adelbert Ames. On April 20, 1863 he was promoted to First Lieutenant of Company F.
Taiping Tianguo<SEP>Although he was best known in the West for his generally pro-modern stance and importance as a negotiator, Li antagonised the British with his support of Russia as a foil against Japanese expansionism in Manchuria and fell from favour with the Chinese after their defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War. His image in China remains controversial, with criticism on one hand for political and military mistakes and praise on the other for his success against <ENT>Taiping Tianguo<ENT> , his diplomatic skills defending Chinese interests in the era of unequal treaties, and his role pioneering China's industrial and military modernisation. He was presented the Royal Victorian Order by Queen Victoria. The French newspaper Le Siècle described him as "the yellow Bismarck."
Stalingrad<SEP>The Wehrmacht's defeat in <ENT>Stalingrad<ENT> led Finland to basically revert to its 19th-century traditions, which had been perceived as highly successful until the Russification of Finland (1899–1905).  Finland's leaders realised that opposing the Soviets head-on was no longer feasible. No international power was able to give the necessary support. Nazi Germany, Finland's chief supporter against Russia, was losing the war. Sweden was not big enough, and its leadership was wary of confronting Russia. The western powers were allied with the Soviet Union. Thus Finland had to face its bigger neighbour on its own, without any great power's protection. As in the 19th century, Finland chose not to challenge Soviet Russia's foreign policy, but exerted caution to keep its independence.
Kurukshetra<SEP>The story of the film is based on Hindu epic Mahabharata and depicts a series of conflicts between Pandavas and Kauravas. Vidura, who was half-brother to the kings Dhritarashtra (father of Kauravas) and Pandu (father of Pandavas) of Hastinapura, is the main character of the film and the events of the film are portrayed from his perspective. Throughout the film, Vidura shows his compassion and sympathy towards Pandavas multiple times. He gives condolences to Pandavas and assures them that truth always prevails, Kauravas will be punished soon for their sins. The series of conflicts between Pandavas and Kauravas finally leads to the <ENT>Kurukshetra<ENT> .
Stalingrad<SEP>During World War II, national governments on occasion declared certain cities open, effectively surrendering them to an advancing enemy in order to avoid damage and bloodshed. Urban warfare proved decisive, however, in <ENT>Stalingrad<ENT> , where Soviet forces repulsed German occupiers, with extreme casualties and destruction. In an era of low-intensity conflict and rapid urbanization, cities have become sites of long-term conflict waged both by foreign occupiers and by local governments against insurgency. Such warfare, known as counterinsurgency, involves techniques of surveillance and psychological warfare as well as close combat, functionally extends modern urban crime prevention, which already uses concepts such as defensible space.
Indianapolis<SEP>The United States Auto Club (USAC) is one of the sanctioning bodies of auto racing in the United States. From 1956 to 1979, USAC sanctioned the United States National Championship, and from 1956 to 1997 the organization sanctioned <ENT>Indianapolis<ENT> . Today, USAC serves as the sanctioning body for a number of racing series, including the Silver Crown Series, National Sprint Cars, National Midgets, Speed2 Midget Series, .25 Midget Series, Stadium Super Trucks, TORC: The Off-Road Championship, and Pirelli World Challenge.
Tower Hill<SEP>Convoy UR 42 departed Loch Ewe on 22 September 1942 and arrived at Reykjavík on 27 September. At 16:16 German time (15:16 British Double Summer Time) Empire Bell was torpedoed and sunk by U-442 at 62°19′N 15°27′W﻿ / ﻿62.317°N 15.450°W﻿ / 62.317; -15.450Coordinates: 62°19′N 15°27′W﻿ / ﻿62.317°N 15.450°W﻿ / 62.317; -15.450 with the loss of ten of her 41 crew. The survivors were picked up by SS Lysaker IV and landed at Reykjavík. Those lost on Empire Bell are commemorated at <ENT>Tower Hill<ENT> , London.
Boston<SEP>The 1st New Hampshire Regiment was an infantry unit that came into existence on 22 May 1775 at the beginning of the American Revolutionary War. John Stark was the regiment's first commander. The unit fought at Chelsea Creek and Bunker Hill in 1775. On 1 January 1776, while engaged in <ENT>Boston<ENT> , the unit was renamed the 5th Continental Regiment. In the spring it was sent to Canada where the New Hampshire soldiers fought at Trois-Rivières and later helped defend the area around Lake Champlain. Late in the year, the 5th Continental Regiment was transferred south to George Washington's main army where it fought at Trenton.
Iwo Jima<SEP>The prow, mainmast, and two guns of the USS Indiana (BB-58) are erected at the western entrance of the stadium.  The battleship saw extensive service in the Pacific Theater during World War II, taking part in the invasion of the Gilbert Islands, Marshall Islands, Marianas campaign, and <ENT>Iwo Jima<ENT> and earning nine battle stars.
Irish independence<SEP>There are a number of political parties in Ireland, and coalition governments are common. The state is unusual as a developed nation in that politics is not primarily characterised by the left-right political divide. The two largest political parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, arose from a split in the original Sinn Féin party in the 1922–1923 Civil War, Fine Gael from the faction (Cumann na nGaedheal) that supported the <ENT>Irish independence<ENT> and Fianna Fáil from the anti-Treaty faction. This enduring characteristic of the Irish party system is sometimes pejoratively referred to as "Civil War politics". The Labour Party was formed in 1912, and it has usually been the third party in parliamentary strength, though it is currently the fourth largest party in Dáil Éireann. In recent years, Sinn Féin has risen to prominence, surpassing the Labour Party in the 2016 general election.
Potsdam<SEP>In May 1945, Czechoslovak troops took possession of the borderland. A Czechoslovak administrative commission composed exclusively of Czechs was established. Sudeten Germans were subjected to restrictive measures and conscripted for compulsory labor. On 15 June, however, Beneš called Czechoslovak authorities to order. In July, Czechoslovak representatives addressed <ENT>Potsdam<ENT> (the U.S., Britain and the Soviet Union) and presented plans for a "humane and orderly transfer" of the Sudeten German population. There were substantial exceptions from expulsions that applied to about 244,000 ethnic Germans who were allowed to remain in Czechoslovakia.
Monaco<SEP>The following twenty-two Grands Prix are due to be run as part of the 2020 World Championship. Each race will be run over the minimum number of laps that exceeds a total distance of 305 km (189.5 mi); the only exception to this is <ENT>Monaco<ENT> , for which the distance is 260 km (161.6 mi).
Indy<SEP>The Milwaukee Mile hosted its first motor race in 1903, and is one of the oldest tracks in the world. The Indianapolis Motor Speedway, opened in 1909, is a prestigious auto racing track which annually hosts <ENT>Indy<ENT> , the Brickyard 400, and the Indianapolis Motorcycle Grand Prix. The Road America and Mid-Ohio road courses opened in the 1950s and 1960s respectively. Other motorsport venues in the Midwest are Indianapolis Raceway Park, Michigan International Speedway, Chicagoland Speedway, Kansas Speedway, Gateway International Raceway, and the Iowa Speedway. The Kentucky Speedway is just outside the officially defined Midwest, but is linked with the region because the track is located in the Cincinnati metropolitan area.
Le Mans<SEP>The Spa 24 Hours was conceived by Jules de Their and Henri Langlois Van Ophem just one year after the <ENT>Le Mans<ENT> was run. It debuted in 1924 over a 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) circuit on public roads between the towns of Francorchamps, Malmedy and Stavelot, under the auspices of the Royal Automobile Club Belgium (RACB). The present 7.004 kilometres (4.352 mi) circuit was inaugurated in 1979 with only slight variations since then.
Lyme<SEP>This plant is adaptable and flourishes in a wide range of conditions. In the United States, it was historically planted to control erosion and in hedges. It propagated itself rapidly by avian dispersion of its seeds and soon thereafter naturalized. Notably, in the understories of deciduous woodlands of the eastern United States it forms dense thickets, the shade of whose canopies prevent the growth of native shrubs, juvenile trees, and wild flowers. Uncontrolled, these growths result in almost monocultural thickets of Amur honeysuckle. The species gravely jeopardizes not only the diversity of the invaded ecosystems but even the regeneration of woodlands, because it reduces the growth and diversity of native seedlings. Additionally, studies indicate that it negatively affects birds and tadpoles. Even if its shrubs are removed, the affected habitat may not recover absent substantial human effort. A study conducted in the vicinity of St. Louis, Missouri in 2010 indicated that the plant increases the risk of tick-borne diseases such as Erlichiosis and <ENT>Lyme<ENT> in suburban natural areas by attracting deer and consequently increasing the presence of infected ticks. Furthermore, experimental removal of the plant was shown to reduce deer activity and the number of infected ticks by shifting ticks' blood meals from deer.
Mysore<SEP>The city celebrates the famous festival called "THE GRAND DASARA" every year in the month of September / October, it is celebrated over 10 days. Devotees wore many fancy dresses to worship Kulasai Shri Mutharamman. It is very famous next to <ENT>Mysore<ENT> .
Bataan<SEP>At the onset of World War II in 1941, thirty-three colleges and universities in the Philippines had organized ROTC units, the cadets and officers of which would see action for the first time. Elements from different ROTC units in Metro Manila took part in <ENT>Bataan<ENT> . ROTC cadets of Silliman University in the Visayas made up 45% of the strength of the 75th Infantry Regiment of the United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE). Volunteers from the Philippine Military Academy and various other ROTC units formed the Hunters ROTC guerrilla group, which took part in the resistance movement during the Japanese occupation after the last American and Filipino forces had surrendered.
Gettysburg<SEP>In April 1861, shortly after the Civil War began with the bombardment of Fort Sumter by rebel forces, Walker predicted that Washington, D.C. and Boston would fall to the Confederacy before May 1 of that year. However, this never happened, and the last time that General Robert E. Lee's army ever invaded the North was his Pennsylvania Campaign, which ended at <ENT>Gettysburg<ENT> , which the Union forces won. The Confederacy would never again attempt to invade the Union after that.
Stalingrad<SEP>The unrelated SU-76i (the "i" standing for "Inostrannaya", or "Foreign" in Russian), first designed and fielded in 1943, was based on captured stocks of German Panzer III and StuG III chassis, a large quantity coming from defeated German troops after <ENT>Stalingrad<ENT> that year. This partially-modified vehicle was armed with a S-1 76.2 mm tank gun (a cheaper variant of the renowned F-34/ZiS-5 guns which were already mounted on T-34 and KV-1 tanks respectively) in a casemate superstructure but retained the original German Maybach gasoline engine and its torsion-bar suspension system. Around 200 of these ex-German vehicles were sent for conversion into SU-76is at Factory No. 37 to supplement the existing SU-76. They were issued to tank and self-propelled gun units starting in the fall of 1943. They were eventually withdrawn from the front in early 1944 and then used for training and testing until the end of 1945. Only 2 have survived the war, most having been scrapped after 1945.
Lyme<SEP>TBE, like <ENT>Lyme<ENT> , is one of the many tick-borne diseases.
Indianapolis<SEP>Purdue's Band was formed in 1886 and named the 'All-American' Marching Band in 1935. The AAMB has made 99 consecutive appearances as the host band for <ENT>Indianapolis<ENT> . The AAMB performs at all home football games where they play the university fight songs, Hail Purdue! being the most famous, and other songs ranging from jazz to rock.
Indianapolis<SEP>He drove in the AAA Championship Car series in the 1949 and 1950 seasons with 4 starts, including the <ENT>Indianapolis<ENT> .  He finished in the top ten once, in 6th position at Milwaukee in 1950.
Nürnberg<SEP>The first baron's eldest son and heir, Hon. Clive Lawrence, predeceased him; he had been HM Procurator General and Treasury Solicitor from 1923 until his death in 1926. Hence, on the first baron's death, the title passed to his second son, Charles. His third son the Hon. Geoffrey Lawrence was also a noted jurist and served as the main British judge at <ENT>Nürnberg<ENT> . In 1947 he was himself raised to the peerage as Baron Oaksey, of Oaksey in the County of Wilts. In 1959 he succeeded his elder brother Charles as third Baron Trevethin, although he continued to be known as Lord Oaksey.
Taiping Tianguo<SEP>Religion can be cited as the motivation for terrorism in conflicts that have a variety of ethnic, economic and political causes, such as the one in Bosnia. In cases such as the Lord's Resistance Army or <ENT>Taiping Tianguo<ENT> the beliefs of the founders differ significantly from what is recognizably Christian. In such cases the term Christian terrorism is problematic despite the claim that they are motivated by their religious beliefs.
Black Oak<SEP>Artists who have been accused of backmasking include Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Electric Light Orchestra, Queen, Styx, Judas Priest, The Eagles, The Rolling Stones, Jefferson Starship, AC/DC, <ENT>Black Oak<ENT> , Rush, Britney Spears, and Eminem.
Kings Mountain<SEP>Some 20 miles (32 km) east of Pinnacle on State Route 1186 is the Rock House, the remains of a massive four-story stone structure with three-foot-thick walls built in 1770 by Capt. John 'Jack' Martin, one of the first two settlers of Stokes County, on a 8,000-acre (32 km) grant from the Crown. Martin served in the North Carolina House of Representatives and as presiding judge of Stoke County court for over 30 years. The house was built by slaves using local flint stones, with a fireplace large enough to roast an ox and stuccoed white plaster on the exterior, and was used as a blockhouse by early settlers. Colonel Martin, who was born in Essex County, Virginia and became a fierce fighter for the Continental cause during the Revolutionary War. Targeted by Tories during and following the War, when he was badly wounded while spying for American forces on the eve of <ENT>Kings Mountain<ENT> , Martin was the brother of militia General Joseph Martin, namesake of Martinsville, Virginia. Col. Jack Martin saw action at the battles of Chestnut Ridge, Surrey County, Colsons, Old Fields, Alamance and Guilford Courthouse. The Rock House served as the mustering ground for colonial forces during the Revolutionary War as well as the War of 1812. One of the oldest structures in Stokes County and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, the house burned in 1890, and only the great rock walls remain. Rock House was acquired in 1975 by the Stokes County Historical Society, which has struggled recently to protect the ruins from vandals.
Cardis<SEP>When the term expired, Russia's military position in the war with Poland had deteriorated to such a point that tsar Alexei Mikhailovich could not allow himself to be involved into a new conflict against powerful Sweden. His boyars had no other choice but to sign <ENT>Cardis<ENT> in 1661, which obliged Russia to yield its Livonian and Ingrian conquests to Sweden, confirming the provisions of the Treaty of Stolbovo. This settlement was observed until the Great Northern War broke out in 1700.
Tower Hill<SEP>Convoy SL 126 departed Freetown, Sierra Leone on 12 March 1943 and arrived at Liverpool on 1 April. Empire Bowman was on a voyage from Karachi, India to Hull via Mormugao, India; Durban, South Africa and Freetown. She was carrying a cargo which included 5,791 tons of general cargo and 2,500 tons of manganese ore. On 30 March, Empire Bowman was torpedoed by U-404 at 47°26′N 15°53′W﻿ / ﻿47.433°N 15.883°W﻿ / 47.433; -15.883Coordinates: 47°26′N 15°53′W﻿ / ﻿47.433°N 15.883°W﻿ / 47.433; -15.883, some 425 nautical miles (787 km) northwest of Cape Finisterre. The captain, 39 crewmembers and six DEMS gunners were rescued by HMS Wear and landed at Liverpool. Four crew were killed; they are commemorated on <ENT>Tower Hill<ENT> . Her Second Engineer, Gordon Love Bastian, rescued two stokers from the sinking ships' flooded engine room at great personal risk. For this act, he was awarded the Albert Medal on 17 August 1943, the citation read:
Stalingrad<SEP>Friedrich Wilhelm Ernst Paulus (23 September 1890 – 1 February 1957) was a German field marshal during World War II who commanded the 6th Army during <ENT>Stalingrad<ENT> (August 1942 to February 1943). The battle ended in disaster for the Wehrmacht when Soviet forces encircled the Germans within the city, leading to the ultimate defeat and capture of about 265,000 German personnel, their Axis allies and collaborators.
Lyme<SEP>Serological testing is typically used to obtain a definitive diagnosis. Most serological tests would succeed only after a certain period of time past the symptom onset (usually a week). The differential diagnosis list includes typhus, ehrlichiosis, leptospirosis, <ENT>Lyme<ENT> and virus-caused exanthema (measles or rubella).
Mons<SEP>In August 1914 he travelled to France as a mechanic with 3 Squadron after war was declared, which followed the German invasion of Belgium. It operated as a reconnaissance unit and McCudden began to fly as an observer. After stopping at Amiens for several days, the unit began reconnoitering enemy positions. 3 Squadron offered support to the British Army at <ENT>Mons<ENT> in Belgium. That month McCudden saw his first German aircraft on 22 August. On 25 August the British began their retreat, south-west, toward Paris. 3 Squadron moved to no fewer than nine different landing grounds, often delaying departure until the enemy was only a mile or two behind. Eventually they settled at Melun, south of Paris. In the autumn, McCudden participated in locating German artillery positions as the Allied armies drove back the enemy at the First Battle of the Marne and First Battle of the Aisne. McCudden flew these missions with a rifle since aircraft lacked any fixed armament.
Kronstadt<SEP>As <ENT>Kronstadt<ENT> occurred at a time when the debate on tactics was still raging within the Comintern, it has been wrongly seen as being left communist by some commentators. In fact, the left communist currents had no connection with the rebellion, although they did rally to its support when they learned of it. In later years, the German-Dutch tradition in particular would come to see the suppression of the revolt as the historic turning point in the evolution of the Russian state after October 1917.
Aughrim<SEP>By a commission dated 20 November 1688, the regiment was formed in Torbay, Devon under Sir Richard Peyton as Peyton's Regiment of Foot. (The regiment's name changed according to the name of the colonel commanding until 1751.) The regiment served in the Glorious Revolution under King William III and at the Battle of the Boyne in July 1690 and <ENT>Aughrim<ENT> in 1691. During the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714), it aided in the capture of Spanish galleons at Battle of Vigo Bay in 1702. The regiment distinguished itself at the Battle of Dettingen in June 1743 and at the Battle of Fontenoy in May 1745. It also served at the Battle of Culloden in April 1746 during the Jacobite rising of 1745.
Indy<SEP>In the last year of the 1.5-liter formula, Jim Clark had clinched his second Drivers' Championship (as well as winning <ENT>Indy<ENT> ) before the teams arrived in North America for the season's last two races. Once again, however, it was Graham Hill and BRM who reigned at The Glen, winning for the third year in a row. Hill took pole, win and fastest lap, finishing twelve seconds ahead of the Brabhams of Dan Gurney and Sir Jack.
Sebring<SEP>In 2011, Oreca won <ENT>Sebring<ENT> race despite still using a 2010-spec car versus the new for 2011 Peugeot 908s.
Gettysburg<SEP>Jorge "George" Newbery, born Jorge Alejandro Newbery (29 May 1875 in Buenos Aires – 1 March 1914 in Mendoza Province), was an Argentine aviator, civil servant, engineer and scientist with ancestry from the United States of America.  His father, Ralph Newbery (a dentist born in 1848), emigrated from Long Island to Argentina after the American Civil War (in which he is said to have taken part in <ENT>Gettysburg<ENT> ). Along with Alberto Braniff and Jorge Chávez, Jorge Newbery was one of the first Latin American aircraft pilots.  He was also an engineer, and is considered to be the architect and founder of the Argentine Air Force.
Talavera<SEP>On 28 July 1809 at <ENT>Talavera<ENT> , Lapisse's 6,862-strong division consisted of the same organization as at Espinosa. At 2:00 pm, 80 French cannons began firing on the British infantry positions, inflicting losses. The fire of the 30 British and six Spanish field pieces was quickly suppressed. Lapisse advanced together with the divisions of Horace François Bastien, baron Sébastiani and Jean François Leval. The Dutch-German division of Leval on the left struck the British line first and was defeated; a second attack later in the day met the same fate. At about 3:00 pm, Sébastiani in the center and Lapisse on the right closed with John Coape Sherbrooke's British-KGL division. Each French division was 12 battalions strong with the front line deployed in column of divisions and the rear line in column of battalions. Lapisse's front line consisted of Jean-Gregoire Laplane's brigade, the 16th Light and the 45th Line. In front of Lapisse were two KGL brigades under Ernst Langwerth and Sigismund Löw plus the 2nd Battalion of the 83rd Foot. The French skirmish line pressed back the less numerous skirmishers of their enemies. Despite taking losses from musketry, Sherbrooke's troops waited until the French were within 50 yards (46 m) then fired a murderous volley. The French infantry were cut down in hundreds and the survivors took to their heels with their enemies in pursuit. However, the British Guards and KGL units went too far and when they came up against the intact French second line, they were defeated. The troops facing Lapisse were badly mauled; the 2nd KGL Infantry Battalion sustained 387 casualties in 20 minutes and the 5th KGL lost over 100 men captured. Langwerth was killed. The divisions of Sébastiani and Lapisse again advanced into contact with the British line, into which Wellesley threw his reserves. Soon a terrific firefight raged. After losing 1,700 men and inflicting about the same number, the French fell back, their attack beaten. Lapisse was fatally wounded during the attack. He died at Santa Olalla two days later. LAPISSE is engraved on Column 37 of the Arc de Triomphe.
Potsdam<SEP>Following World War II, Britain retained control of both British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland as protectorates. In 1945, during <ENT>Potsdam<ENT> , the United Nations granted Italy trusteeship of Italian Somaliland, but only under close supervision and on the condition — first proposed by the Somali Youth League (SYL) and other nascent Somali political organizations, such as Hizbia Digil Mirifle Somali (HDMS) and the Somali National League (SNL) — that Somalia achieve independence within ten years. British Somaliland remained a protectorate of Britain until 1960.
Fredericksburg<SEP>Sumner fought in the Black Hawk War, with distinction in the Mexican–American War, on the Western frontier, and in the Eastern Theater for the first half of the Civil War. He led the II Corps of the Army of the Potomac through the Peninsula Campaign, the Seven Days Battles, and the Maryland Campaign, and the Right Grand Division of the Army during <ENT>Fredericksburg<ENT> . He died in March 1863 while awaiting transfer.
Glastonbury<SEP>They have previously been responsible for Big Chill festival, which last ran in 2011, and were the operators of <ENT>Glastonbury<ENT> from 2002 until 2012.
Le Mans<SEP>Jean Bugatti, son of Bugatti founder Ettore Bugatti, hired Pierre Veyron in 1932 as a test driver and development engineer. Veyron entered races as a Bugatti company driver, winning many including the 1933 and 1934 Berlin Avus races while driving a Bugatti Type 51A. Veyron's most significant race victory was his 1939 win at <ENT>Le Mans<ENT> , co-driving a Bugatti Type 57S Tank with Jean-Pierre Wimille.
Kosovo<SEP>Upon the outbreak of <ENT>Kosovo<ENT> in 1999, Lukashenko suggested to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milošević that Yugoslavia join the Union of Russia and Belarus.
Boston<SEP>The Pine Tree Riot was a test of the British royal authority. This is partially evident by the light fines exacted against the rioters. Some believe this to be an inspiring act for <ENT>Boston<ENT> .
Montijo<SEP>The subsequent Portuguese Restoration War against Philip III (Portuguese: Guerra da Restauração) consisted mainly of small skirmishes near the border. The most significant battles being <ENT>Montijo<ENT> on May 26, 1644, the Battle of the Lines of Elvas (1659), the Battle of Ameixial (1663), the Battle of Castelo Rodrigo (1664), and the Battle of Montes Claros (1665); the Portuguese were victorious in all of these battles.
Tower Hill<SEP>Convoy OB 318 departed Liverpool on  2 May 1941 and arrived at Halifax on 10 May. Empire Caribou was carrying a cargo of 2,020 tons of chalk and was bound for Boston, Massachusetts. On 10 May, she was torpedoed and sunk by U-556 at 59°28′N 35°44′W﻿ / ﻿59.467°N 35.733°W﻿ / 59.467; -35.733Coordinates: 59°28′N 35°44′W﻿ / ﻿59.467°N 35.733°W﻿ / 59.467; -35.733, with the loss of 29 members of her 40 member crew. Eleven survivors were rescued by HMS Malcolm. They were landed at Reykjavík, Iceland and transferred to HMS Scimitar which took them to Greenock. Those lost on Empire Caribou are commemorated at <ENT>Tower Hill<ENT> , London.
Glastonbury<SEP>After hosting live coverage of <ENT>Glastonbury<ENT> and the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, Middlemiss presented Rough Cut and Dog’s Balearics. She was one of the original presenters on the new digital station BBC 6 Music in 2002, presenting the Music Week, where she remained until she left in April 2004.
Blarney<SEP>Evans is buried in the grounds of Swansea's Bethesda Chapel, it is believed to bring good luck if you kiss the headstone of Christmas Evans, making it the Swansea version of <ENT>Blarney<ENT> .
Daytona<SEP>2007 Wendlinger competed at <ENT>Daytona<ENT> with Sigal Sport team in a BMW powered Riley DP. He crashed during the night on his in lap at the end of his second stint and was sent to the hospital as a precaution. The car eventually was retired from the damage.
Pleven<SEP>Romania's independence from the Ottoman Empire was achieved mainly with Russian assistance, although during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877 the Russians requested military assistance from Romania during <ENT>Pleven<ENT> , after suffering heavy losses.
Kosovo<SEP>The war in the western parts of former Yugoslavia ended in 1995 with US-sponsored peace talks in Dayton, Ohio, which resulted in the Dayton Agreement. The five years of disintegration and war led to a sanctions regime, causing the economy to collapse. <ENT>Kosovo<ENT> started in 1996 and ended with the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia; Slobodan Milošević was overthrown in 2000.
Battle of Kortrijk<SEP>Simon II of Clermont, Seigneur of Nesle through his mother Gertrude, was regent of the kingdom of France during the second crusade of Saint Louis. Raoul II/III of Clermont, constable of France, and Guy I and Guy II (d. 1352) of Clermont, both marshals of France, were members of the family. The brothers Raoul and Guy I were both notable casualties of <ENT>Battle of Kortrijk<ENT> 1302, a French military disaster in the County of Flanders in the Franco-Flemish War (1297-1305).
Daytona<SEP>In 2013 his younger brother Ricardo won the 81st edition of the 24 Hours of Le Mans in LMP2. In 2019, Roberto went on to win <ENT>Daytona<ENT> and the 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps, both in the LMP2 class.
Irish Republic<SEP>David Lean's 1970 film Ryan's Daughter takes place at a village on the Dingle Peninsula in the immediate aftermath of the <ENT>Irish Republic<ENT> , and was partly shot on location near Dún Chaoin, Coumeenole Beach, Slea Head and Inch Strand.  Far and Away, a 1992 film directed by Ron Howard, was partly filmed on the peninsula.
Black Oak<SEP>Born in Memphis, Tennessee, Lane began playing piano with his sisters at the age of eight, but did not play guitar seriously until he was ten. At age 12–13 he began to practice heavily. At fourteen, he became the lead guitarist for <ENT>Black Oak<ENT> (BOA) and alongside members, including drummer Tommy Aldridge, toured over the next four years opening shows for bands including REO Speedwagon, Ted Nugent, Outlaws, Cheap Trick, Molly Hatchet and Blue Öyster Cult. During 1979 Shawn played in The Streets, recording studio demos with Andy Tanas on bass, Chris Craig on drums and Jimmy Henderson on guitar, almost securing a deal with Epic Records.
Haitian<SEP>Although Napoleon and France took de jure control of Spanish Missouri in 1800, the transfer remained secret; Spanish officials remained in control of Missouri and all of Louisiana throughout the period of French ownership. In February 1802, the French sent a military force to reconquer St. Domingue as a stepping stone to enforce control of New France, but throughout the year, disease and the <ENT>Haitian<ENT> ended the French expedition. In October 1802, these officials suspended foreign trade at the port of New Orleans, which led the United States to negotiate with France to purchase New Orleans in March 1803. However, the French defeat in Haiti and the desire for money to fight Britain led Napoleon to sell all of Louisiana, including Missouri, to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase.
Stalingrad<SEP>Baku's largest industry is petroleum, and its petroleum exports make it a large contributor to Azerbaijan's balance of payments. The existence of petroleum has been known since the 8th century. In the 10th century, the Arabian traveler, Marudee, reported that both white and black oil were being extracted naturally from Baku. By the 15th century, oil for lamps was obtained from hand-dug surface wells. Commercial exploitation began in 1872, and by the beginning of the 20th century the Baku oil fields were the largest in the world. Towards the end of the 20th century much of the onshore petroleum had been exhausted, and drilling had extended into the sea offshore. By the end of the 19th century skilled workers and specialists flocked to Baku. By 1900 the city had more than 3,000 oil wells, of which 2,000 were producing oil at industrial levels. Baku ranked as one of the largest centres for the production of oil industry equipment before World War II. The World War <ENT>Stalingrad<ENT> was fought to determine who would have control of Baku oil fields. Fifty years before the battle, Baku produced half of the world's oil supply.
Glastonbury<SEP>1999 ended for the duo with a world tour, which continued well into 2000, this time with the stage sets designed by architect Zaha Hadid. The tour took them to the United States, Canada, Japan, Europe and the UK. In the Summer of 2000, they also played a series of festival dates in Europe, including a performance at <ENT>Glastonbury<ENT> , where they performed on the main stage, on Saturday night, at 9:30 pm, to a triumphant reception. In 2000, they won their third Ivor Novello Award, honouring their "Outstanding Contribution" to music. Throughout 2000, they continued to work on their musical and in May they started workshopping the project and finalising the plot and songs to be used.
Gettysburg<SEP>The dedication on the west (Main Street) side honors those who laid down their lives "in the war to maintain the union for the cause of their country and of mankind." Half of Abraham Lincoln's <ENT>Gettysburg<ENT> graces the east side of the monument. Several bas-relief panels feature scenes of Lincoln's original cabinet: Treasury Secretary Salmon Chase, Secretary of State William H. Seward, Attorney General Edward Bates, Postmaster General Montgomery Blair, Secretary of the Interior, Caleb Smith, Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, Major General Winfield Scott, and Secretary of War Simon Cameron.
Sebring<SEP>The 250 TR achieved many racing successes, with variations winning 10 World Sports Car Championship races including the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1958, 1960, and 1961, <ENT>Sebring<ENT> in 1958, 1959 and 1961, the Targa Florio in 1958, the 1000 Km Buenos Aires in 1958 and 1960 and the Pescara 4 Hours in 1961. These results led to World Sports Car Championship constructor's titles for Ferrari in 1958, 1960 and 1961.
Schengen<SEP>Wals-Siezenheim is located immediately at Salzburg Airport with access to the Salzburg trolleybus system. It is the site of extended shopping malls and several branches of major industrial companies. The Walserberg locality is widely known for the former border checkpoint on the Austrian West Autobahn to the German Bundesautobahn 8. Border controls have been abolished with the implementation of <ENT>Schengen<ENT> in 1997.
Sebring<SEP>The Turbo S LM-GT made its debut at the <ENT>Sebring<ENT> where the car finished seventh overall and first in its class with the Brumos Porsche racing team.  From there, the car was entered in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, running under the guise of the Porsche factory team.  The car would however fail to finish after the engine was damaged early in the race.  For 1994, the Turbo S LM-GT would be moved to the hands of Larbre Compétition, where a new 3.6 liter engine based on the 993 unit would be used in place of the 3.2 liter engine.  The team opened the year with a second-place finish at the 24 Hours of Daytona, before moving on to select rounds of the BPR Global GT Series.  The car would win all four races in which it competed, including the 1000 km Suzuka.  The Turbo S LM-GT would make a few select appearances in 1995 with Obermaier Racing before being retired.
Monaco<SEP>During the post-race press conference, Hamilton revealed the decision to pit him was made after he had voiced concern over the heat in his tyres, being under the false impression that his rivals behind had already made a pit stop for the softer compound. When asked whether he would have full confidence in the team's strategy decisions in the future, he answered "yes". At the podium interviews, conducted by Martin Brundle, Rosberg admitted his victory "was just a lot of luck" and added that "Lewis drove brilliantly and he would have also deserved the win for sure". Rosberg became the fourth driver overall, and the first since Ayrton Senna, to win <ENT>Monaco<ENT> three times in a row.
Wuchang<SEP>Tuva, today a federal subject of Russia, had been Chinese territory from the Yuan dynasty up until <ENT>Wuchang<ENT> of 1911 when Tsar Nicholas II of Russia annexed the region. A nominally independent state was formed, which after the Russian Revolution—during the Russian Civil War—came to be occupied by the Red Army, the White movement and the Republic of China. After retaking it from the Chinese, the Russian Bolsheviks established Tannu Tuva on 14 August 1921 as another nominally independent state.
Cheltenham<SEP>Having contracted a virus, shortly before the 1981 Aintree Festival, Sea Pigeon never recovered fully and ran poorly in two races in the autumn of 1981. He was retired just before the <ENT>Cheltenham<ENT> . He had won 21 races from 40 starts over jumps and 16 races from 45 starts on the flat.
Hastings<SEP>There is no evidence of Eudo having been at <ENT>Hastings<ENT> , although some have speculated that Wace may have designated him as the Sire de Préaux which Eudo was in possession of by 1070. After the Norman Conquest of England all five brothers and their father were in England.
San Remo<SEP>In 1982, Rossi took part for the first time in <ENT>San Remo<ENT> , performing the song "Vado al massimo" ("I'm taking it to the max").  Here, he once again found himself under harsh criticism, and came in last place in the festival.  In April of the same year the album Vado al Massimo was released.  The following year, he reappeared at the Sanremo Music Festival, this time performing "Vita spericolata" (Daredevil Life), probably his most popular song, and finishing in second-to-last place due to his apparent state of intoxication. The following album, Bollicine ("Little Bubbles"), published in 1983, was his sixth in seven years, and was the album that consecrated him definitively as an idol of the new generation and an icon of Italian rock.  The title track, whose lyrics are about Coke (but also demonstrate a clear assonance with cocaine), won the Festivalbar '83, and his tour that year was an enormous success.
Taiping Tianguo<SEP>During the First Opium War, the British navy defeated Eight Banners forces at Ningbo and Dinghai. Under the terms of the Treaty of Nanking, signed in 1843, Ningbo became one of the five Chinese treaty ports opened to virtually unrestricted foreign trade.  Much of Zhejiang came under the control of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom during <ENT>Taiping Tianguo<ENT> , which resulted in a considerable loss of life in the north-western and central parts of the province, sparing the rest of Zhejiang from the disastrous depopulation that occurred. In 1876, Wenzhou became Zhejiang's second treaty port. Jianghuai Mandarin speakers later came to settle in these depopulated regions of northern Zhejiang.
Fredericksburg<SEP>After occupying Marye's Heights on May 3, following <ENT>Fredericksburg<ENT> , Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick's VI Corps of about 23,000 men marched out on the Orange Plank Road with the objective of reaching his superior Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker's force at Chancellorsville. He was delayed by Brig. Gen. Cadmus M. Wilcox's brigade of Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early's force during the afternoon of May 3 before halting at Salem Church.
Lyme<SEP>During shooting of the closing scenes for Jackass Number Two in 2006, Dunn injured his shoulder during one of his final bits, where he and co-star Bam Margera are pulled out of shot by a running horse by a rope tied around their feet. Dunn dropped straight onto his shoulder, causing damage to the muscles and leading to a blood clot that was at one point life-threatening, due to its proximity to his heart and brain. While seeking treatment for it and <ENT>Lyme<ENT> , Dunn became depressed, eventually cutting off all contact with his friends, co-workers, and others for nearly two years, and did not participate in Jackassworld.com: 24 Hour Takeover, or any subsequent events related to the films and series. He eventually returned to the Jackass cast in the production of Jackass 3D and Jackass 3.5 later saying that he was happy to rejoin the cast and had more enjoyment working on Jackass 3D than any previous film endeavors.
Stalingrad<SEP>The leadership of the United Kingdom's General Bernard Montgomery at the Second Battle of El Alamein, or the Battle of Alamein at El Alamein in Egypt, marked a significant turning point of World War II and was the first major victory by British Commonwealth forces over the German Army. The battle lasted from 23 October to 3 November 1942. Following the First Battle of El Alamein, which had stalled the Axis advance, British general Bernard Montgomery took command of the Eighth Army from Claude Auchinleck in August 1942. Success in the battle turned the tide in the North African Campaign. Some historians believe that the battle, along with <ENT>Stalingrad<ENT> , were the two major Allied victories that contributed to the eventual defeat of Nazi Germany.
Potsdam<SEP>Stalin attended <ENT>Potsdam<ENT> in July–August 1945, alongside his new British and U.S. counterparts, Prime Minister Clement Attlee and President Harry Truman. At the conference, Stalin repeated previous promises to Churchill that he would refrain from a "Sovietization" of Eastern Europe. Stalin pushed for reparations from Germany without regard to the base minimum supply for German citizens' survival, which worried Truman and Churchill who thought that Germany would become a financial burden for Western powers. He also pushed for "war booty", which would permit the Soviet Union to directly seize property from conquered nations without quantitative or qualitative limitation, and a clause was added permitting this to occur with some limitations. Germany was divided into four zones: Soviet, U.S., British, and French, with Berlin itself—located within the Soviet area—also subdivided thusly.
Hastings<SEP>The semi-mythical account of their line's founding during <ENT>Hastings<ENT> evolved into a national legend.
Potsdam<SEP>During <ENT>Potsdam<ENT> in 1945, the Western Allies briefly advocated a Polish-German border along the Oder, Bóbr and Kwisa rivers, but were rejected by Joseph Stalin, who had already committed himself to the Oder-Neisse line.
Boston<SEP>British soldiers pillaged the house about the time of the Battle of Lexington in April 1775; they also broke down and mutilated the fences for firewood, until a complaint by the selectmen caused General Gage to send Percy to occupy it. He remained there for some time during <ENT>Boston<ENT> . That March, British officers had allegedly set an example to their men by hacking the fences with their swords, breaking windows, etc. A few days later Hancock was again disturbed by the redcoats, who refused to leave the premises at his request and mockingly told him his possessions would soon be theirs.
Le Mans<SEP>After its Formula One program ended, Gordini worked with Renault as an engine tuner, entering Renault-Gordini cars at <ENT>Le Mans<ENT> between 1962 and 1969. It also tuned engines for Alpine, a rival sports car manufacturer also associated with Renault. In 1957, Gordini and Renault manufactured the Dauphine Gordini, a modified version of the Renault Dauphine which was a sales success. Gordini-tuned Renault cars also won various rallies during the 1950s and 1960s. In 1963, the Gordini company planned to move its headquarters to Noisy-le-Roi. At the end of 1968, Gordini retired and sold a 70% majority stake from his firm to Renault. Renault-Gordini was moved to Viry-Châtillon in 1969 and became a sport division of Renault, before being merged with Alpine to form Renault Sport in 1976. On 1 January 1976, René Vuaillat became director of Gordini. The Gordini company name became wholly owned by Renault in 1977.
LM<SEP>Sports car racing is a set of classes of vehicles, over a closed course track, including sports cars, and specialised racing types.  The premiere race is <ENT>LM<ENT> which takes place annually in France during the month of June.  Sports car racing rules and specifications differentiate in North America from established international sanctioning bodies.
Boston<SEP>At the outbreak of hostilities in the American Revolutionary War in 1775, Joseph Leavitt enlisted as Private in the Continental Army for an initial three-month period of service. Leavitt was involved in some of the earliest skirmishes of the War, when he helped fight British forces during <ENT>Boston<ENT> in 1775. At the conclusion of his service in the earliest phase of the Revolutionary War, Leavitt declared himself unable to fight any longer. "Some must stay at home and raise bread," Leavitt was recorded as saying. While others did the fighting, Leavitt said he would instead "raise bread for them."
Boston<SEP>Kendrick was reputed to have participated in <ENT>Boston<ENT> on December 16, 1773. He was an ardent Patriot, going on to serve as commander of  the privateer Fanny, the first ship of what became the Continental Navy during the American Revolution. He was commissioned May 26, 1777.
Indy<SEP>The Duesenberg brothers introduced the first successful straight-eight racing engine in 1920, when their 3 L engine placed third, fourth, and sixth at <ENT>Indy<ENT> . The following year one of their cars won the French Grand Prix, while two others placed fourth and sixth in the race. Based on work the company had done on 16-cylinder aircraft engines during World War I, the overhead camshaft, three-valve-per-cylinder engine produced 115 brake horsepower (86 kW) at 4,250 rpm, and was capable of revving to an astonishing (at the time) 5,000 rpm. No Grand Prix engine before the war had peaked at more than 3,000 rpm.
Mons<SEP>The 1st Battalion, part of the 1st (Guards) Brigade of the 1st Division, was part of the British Expeditionary Force which arrived in France in 1914. The Battalion took part in <ENT>Mons<ENT> in August 1914, the First Battle of the Marne in September 1914 and the Battle of the Aisne also in September 1914. The 1st and 2nd Battalions then took part in the First Battle of Ypres in November 1914, the Battle of Aubers Ridge in May 1915 and the Battle of Loos in September 1915. In July 1916 the Scots Guards took part in the first Battle of the Somme and in July 1917, the regiment began its involvement in the Battle of Passchendaele. In March 1918 they fought at the second Battle of the Somme and in Autumn the regiment took part in the final battles of the war on the Western Front.
Cheltenham<SEP>In January 2016, it was announced that ITV had regained horse racing rights from Channel 4 to take effect from 1 January 2017. 60 days of racing will be shown on ITV4, while 40 days of racing will be shown on ITV. ITV broadcasts big events such as the Grand National, <ENT>Cheltenham<ENT> , Epsom Derby, Royal Ascot, Glorious Goodwood and British Champions Day, as well as regular Saturday meetings.
