Woking<SEP>Two sections of the canal totalling 101.3 hectares are a Site of Special Scientific Interest and Nature Conservation Review site. These are the main length between Greywell and Brookwood Lye and a short stretch between Monument Bridge and Scotland Bridge in <ENT>Woking<ENT> . It is the most botanically rich aquatic area in England and flora include the nationally scarce hairlike pondweed and the nationally scarce tasteless water-pepper. The site is also nationally important for its invertebrates. There are 24 species of dragonfly and other species include two nationally rare Red Data Book insects.
Wakefield<SEP>Like many surrounding areas, Featherstone grew around coal mining. Coal had been mined at Featherstone since the 13th century and remains of bell pits can still be seen to the north of Park Lane at North Featherstone. In 1848, the opening of <ENT>Wakefield<ENT> , Pontefract and Goole railway line through Featherstone provided the basis for large scale coal mining in Featherstone, by opening up new markets in the South of England and Europe. Featherstone Main Colliery was opened in 1866, followed by Ackton Hall Colliery in 1873.  These were closer to what is now the main part of Featherstone, which consequently expanded.
Boston<SEP>Lana went to Bard College in New York and Lilly attended Emerson College in <ENT>Boston<ENT> . Each dropped out before graduating.
Aberdare<SEP>In the Southwest, the line from Bournemouth to Weymouth was electrified along with other infill 750 V DC 3rd rail electrification in the south.  In 1988, the line to <ENT>Aberdare<ENT> was reopened. A British Rail advertisement ("Britain's Railway", directed by Hugh Hudson) featured some of the best known railway structures in Britain, including the Forth Rail Bridge, Royal Albert Bridge, Glenfinnan Viaduct and London Paddington station. London Liverpool Street station was rebuilt, opened by Queen Elizabeth II, and a new station was constructed at Stansted Airport in 1991. The following year, the Maesteg Line was reopened. In 1988, the Windsor Link Line, Greater Manchester was constructed and has proven to be an important piece of infrastructure.
Oswestry<SEP>Ellesmere (/ˈɛlzmɪər/ ELZ-meer) is a market town near <ENT>Oswestry<ENT> in north Shropshire, England, notable for its proximity to a number of prominent lakes known as the Meres.
Southern Cal<SEP>Amtrak's California Zephyr train uses the Union Pacific's original transcontinental railroad line in daily service from Chicago to Emeryville, California, serving Elko, Winnemucca, and Reno. Las Vegas has had no passenger train service since Amtrak's Desert Wind was discontinued in 1997. Amtrak Thruway Motorcoaches provide connecting service from Las Vegas to trains at Needles, California, Los Angeles, and Bakersfield, California; and from Stateline, Nevada, to Sacramento, California. There have been a number of proposals to re-introduce service to either Los Angeles or <ENT>Southern Cal<ENT> .
Oldham<SEP>On the outbreak of war in September 1939, 45th (Leeds Rifles) RTR formed part of the 24th Army Tank Brigade, a 2nd Line Territorial Army formation in Northern Command, in which it served alongside the <ENT>Oldham<ENT> -based TA regiments, 41 RTR and its duplicate, 47 RTR.
Auburn<SEP>In 1881, Upton, having returned to the rank of colonel in 1880, was in command of 4th U.S. Artillery at the Presidio of San Francisco. He suffered greatly from headaches, possibly caused by a brain tumor, and committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. He is buried in Fort Hill Cemetery, <ENT>Auburn<ENT> .
Covent Garden<SEP>In 1872, Abbott went abroad to study with Antonio Sangiovanni in Milan. This was followed by further studies with Mathilde Marchesi, Pierre François Wartel and Enrico Delle Sedie in Paris. She appeared in several productions in Paris, earning rave reviews for her fine soprano voice. She was awarded a contract with the Royal Opera in London and made her début at <ENT>Covent Garden<ENT> as Marie in La Fille du régiment in 1876. However, her contract was cancelled shortly thereafter when she refused to sing Violetta from Verdi's La Traviata on moral grounds. That same year she secretly married Eugene Wetherell (d. 1889) and they returned to the United States, where she remained for the rest of her life.
Helmsley<SEP>Born in <ENT>Helmsley<ENT> , Yorkshire, England, Frank came from a cricketing family.  His elder brother Benjamin, and his father, played club cricket, with Joseph initially playing with Duncombe Park C.C. In total he played in seven first-class matches. His bowling was fast, but his action was suspect, and his biggest impact in the sport came when he played for the Scarborough & District against the Australians in 1880, when he damaged Fred Spofforth's finger an injury that prevented him from playing in the subsequent Test match at The Oval. His cousin, Robert Frank, of Pickering played nineteen times for Yorkshire, and captained the Yorkshire Second XI between 1900 and 1914. Joseph Frank later became a timber merchant.
Eastleigh<SEP>Bitterne Leisure Centre is managed by Active Nation (a national sport and exercise charity) and offers a wide range of activities including swimming, exercise classes, table tennis, a gymnasium, badminton, martial arts and children's activities, including birthday parties. A private gymnasium exists next to the Sainsbury's supermarket on the precinct, a location which formerly housed a ten pin bowling centre. This was opened in 1965 as Excel Bowl before being taken over by AMF Bowling and renamed "Bitterne Bowl". The centre moved to the Swan Centre in <ENT>Eastleigh<ENT> as part of a redevelopment project there in November/December 2008.
Manhattan<SEP>Fox was born and raised in <ENT>Manhattan<ENT> , by Simeon and Esther (née Butler) Fox.   He attended Kansas State University, where he earned a B.S. in mathematics in 1897.  The next year he enlisted in the U.S. Army and fought in the Philippines with the 20th Kansas during the Spanish–American War.  When he was mustered out in 1899, Fox had achieved a rank of second lieutenant but he was disabled and was expected to die within a year.  He recuperated completely, however, thanks to nursing by his mother.
New Mexico<SEP>The "prompt and utter destruction" clause has been interpreted as a veiled warning about American possession of the atomic bomb which had been successfully tested in <ENT>New Mexico<ENT> on July 16, 1945, the day before the Potsdam Conference opened. Although the document warned of further destruction like the Operation Meetinghouse raid on Tokyo and other carpetbombing of Japanese cities, it did not mention anything about the atomic bomb.
Haifa<SEP>Cunningham had retired from the army in October 1946 when he relinquished the role of Commander-in-Chief Palestine, but retained the job of High Commissioner until 1948. As such he had the task of winding up British rule and departing the country in May 1948, with the British mandate expired, in the midst of war between Jewish forces and Palestinian militias, with Arab armies poised to invade as soon as the British withdrew. The photo of Cunningham taking down the British flag at the port of <ENT>Haifa<ENT> is a historical photo often reproduced in Israeli history textbooks.
Lethbridge<SEP>The other members of the Confederacy are the Blackfoot-speaking Káínaa or Blood and the Siksiká or Blackfoot, as well as the Tsuu T'ina or Sarcee who only became allied later and spoke an unrelated language. At the time the treaties were signed, the Northern Peigan were situated on the Oldman River, west of <ENT>Lethbridge<ENT> , Alberta, Canada, to the west of the Kainai tribe.
Toulouse<SEP>Descended from nobility, Maurice de Guérin was born at the château of Le Cayla in Andillac, Tarn. He was raised in a strict Roman Catholic family and educated at a religious seminary in <ENT>Toulouse<ENT> before attending the Collège Stanislas de Paris, where he met Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly—who became his lifelong friend.
Lublin<SEP>The circumstances surrounding Traidenis' advance to power are not clear. While his ancestors are unknown, it is known that he came from Aukštaitija, as he was Duke of Kernavė. From the outset his relationships with Halych-Volhynia were tense as he replaced Shvarn, Duke of Halych-Volhynia and Lithuania. The tension eventually resulted in the 1274–1276 war. Despite Mongol support to Halych-Volhynia, Traidenis was successful in battle and his control over Black Ruthenia (Navahradak, Hrodna, Slonim, and other cities) was strengthened. Traidenis also made incursions into Poland, especially surroundings of <ENT>Lublin<ENT> and Łęczyca, that continued to about 1306. However, these raids did not affect Masovia as Traidenis established a dynastic link through his daughter Gaudemunda with its dukes. This dynastic relationship was further developed by Gediminas.
Dundee<SEP>At the accession of King Charles I Huntly lost much of his influence at court. He was deprived in 1630 of his heritable sheriffships of Aberdeen and Inverness. The same year a feud broke out between the Crichtons and the Gordons, in the course of which Huntly's second son, Lord Melgum, was burnt to death either by treachery or by accident, while being entertained in the house of James Crichton of Frendraught. For the ravaging of the lands of the Crichtons Huntly was held responsible, and having been summoned before the privy council in 1635 he was imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle from December till June 1636. He left his confinement with shattered health, and died at <ENT>Dundee<ENT> while on his journey to Strathbogie on 13 June 1636, after declaring himself a Roman Catholic.
Exeter<SEP>Paignton (/ˈpeɪntən/ PAYN-tən) is a seaside town on the coast of Tor Bay in Devon, England. Together with Torquay and Brixham it forms the borough of Torbay which was created in 1998. The Torbay area is a holiday destination known as the English Riviera. Paignton's population in the United Kingdom Census of 2011 was 49,021. It has origins as a Celtic settlement and was first mentioned in 1086. It grew as a small fishing village and a new harbour was built in 1847. A railway line was opened to passengers in 1859 creating links to Torquay and London. As its population increased, it merged with the villages of Goodrington and Preston. Paignton is around 25 miles (40 km) north east of Plymouth and 20 miles (32 km) south of <ENT>Exeter<ENT> , and has the fourth largest population in Devon.
Sandvika<SEP>Tronstad was born in Bærum; the son of Hans Larsen and Josefine Amalie Tronstad, Hans died three months before Leif was born. Leif thus grew up in <ENT>Sandvika<ENT> with his mother and four siblings. He graduated from middle school in 1918, with top grades in mathematics. He then embarked on thirty months of professional practice in two local electricity companies, which was a requirement to enrol at Kristiania Technical School, a predecessor of the Faculty of Engineering at Oslo University College. When he enrolled in 1920 he chose technical chemistry instead of electronic engineering. He graduated in 1922, the best chemistry student; a fellow student recalled that he "did not have to read anything more than once" in order to remember it. In the spring of 1923, he also took the examen artium after attending the Haagaas School for one year. He was ready to enroll at the Norwegian Institute of Technology, but waited one year, possibly wanting to strengthen his personal finances. In the meantime, he started on his compulsory military service.
Kronstad<SEP>From 1900 to 1904, he commanded the Mediterranean squadron of the Russian Navy becoming vice admiral in 1901. In February 1904 he was appointed commander of the Baltic Fleet and military governor of <ENT>Kronstad<ENT> . In May 1905 he was appointed commander of the Pacific Fleet, and departed for Vladivostok where he was supported to assume command of the Second Pacific Squadron from Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky on its arrival. However, he heard of the defeat at the Battle of Tsushima while still travelling on the Trans-Siberian Railway, and immediately sent a telegram to Tsar Nicholas II asking to be relieved of the command. He returned to Saint Petersburg after only two months in Vladivostok.
Taiping Tianguo<SEP>The fall of Nanking and the collapse of <ENT>Taiping Tianguo<ENT> in 1864 altered Liu's prospects dramatically for the worse.  Imperial forces gradually began to reassert their control over southwest China, and it was only a matter of time before they secured Guangxi province.  To escape their vengeance, Liu needed to make himself sufficiently powerful to give the Imperial generals pause.  His first step was to buy some time by retreating into the mountains of northern Tonkin.  In 1868 he abandoned Wu Yuanqing's rebels and crossed into Vietnam with a force of 200 soldiers whose loyalty he could trust.  He had dreamed as a youth that he would one day become a famous 'General of the Black Tiger', and christened his tiny band of adventurers the Black Flag Army, heiqi jun (hei-ch'i chun, 黑旗軍).  The Black Flags marched slowly through northern Tonkin, recruiting men to their standard as they went, and eventually set up camp just outside Son Tay, on the northern bank of the Red River.
Stalingrad<SEP>In 2003, the company managed to start the construction of the Universal City Telecommunication Network (UCTN) for 200 000 flats in the first city of the project - Perm. The general principle applied to the construction was FTTH (Optics up to Home). Within two years, three cities took part in the project (Perm, Samara and <ENT>Stalingrad<ENT> ).
Eskilstuna<SEP>The 1976 Speedway World Pairs Championship was the seventh FIM Speedway World Pairs Championship. The final took place in <ENT>Eskilstuna<ENT> , Sweden. The championship was won by host England (27 points) who beat Denmark (24 points) and Sweden (22 points).
Carlow<SEP>John Brennan was born at Ballahide, <ENT>Carlow<ENT> , about 1768 and died in Dublin on 29 July 1830. The Compendium of Irish Biography (1878) says of him:
Kassel<SEP>Beginning in 1190, the town was under military protection and the jurisdiction of the Counts of Katzenelnbogen, the monastery Vögte, who had taken ownership. In 1245, Count Diether V of Katzenelnbogen built the castle, Burg Rheinfels. When the last of the Counts of Katzenelnbogen died in 1479, Sankt Goar passed to the Landgraviate of Hesse. On 1 November 1527, Adam Krafft, who would later be a professor of theology, began to introduce the Reformation on a mission from Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse. In 1567, upon Philip's death, the Landgraviate of Hesse was divided among his four sons. His youngest son, Philip II, Landgrave of Hesse-Rheinfels, was awarded the Lower County of Katzenelnbogen, and thereby the castle and the town. In 1580, 175 people in Sankt Goar fell victim to the Plague; only 18 years later, in 1598, it claimed another 142. In 1635, in the midst of the Thirty Years' War, more than 200 people died in another outbreak. In 1598, Franz Schmoll built the Rheinfels-Apotheke in Sankt Goar, only the third apothecary in Hesse, after the ones in <ENT>Kassel<ENT> and Marburg.
Sanford<SEP>In the early 1990s, May moved to Central Florida, where she continued to teach strings, help her husband expand his burgeoning youth orchestras, and gave birth to two more children. As an accomplished cellist, May quickly joined the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra and the Bach Festival Orchestra. May was the orchestra director at Maitland Middle School and Winter Park High School, and also started the strings program at Park Maitland School.  Despite a terrible car accident that threatened her career as a cellist and music teacher, she would also teach music at Millennium Middle School in <ENT>Sanford<ENT> and build a comprehensive strings program with Jonathan at Trinity Preparatory School, where she has worked for the last 10 years. She also performs with her own chamber group the Dolce Chamber Players and is a frequent performer at area events, including Walt Disney World's Candlelight Processional. She has also performed in accompanying orchestras with many notable pop musicians such as Jimmy Page, Harry Connick Jr., Donny Osmond, Smokey Robinson, as well as famous tenors Luciano Pavarotti and Andrea Bocelli.
Rockhampton<SEP>The following 18 players have been named in the Australia squad for the Oceania Cup, from 5 to 8 September in <ENT>Rockhampton<ENT> , Australia.
Armavir<SEP>Coordinates: 40°02′26″N 44°04′03″E﻿ / ﻿40.04056°N 44.06750°E﻿ / 40.04056; 44.06750 Pshatavan (Armenian: Փշատավան); formerly, Igdalu and Igdali) is a town in <ENT>Armavir<ENT> of Armenia.
West Edmonton<SEP>The Grey Cup (French: Coupe Grey) is the name of both the championship game of the Canadian Football League (CFL) and the trophy awarded to the victorious team playing in the namesake championship of professional Canadian football. It is contested between the winners of the CFL's East and West Divisional playoffs and is one of Canadian television's largest annual sporting events. The Toronto Argonauts have the most Grey Cup wins (17) since its introduction in 1909, while the Edmonton Eskimos have the most Grey Cup wins (11) since the creation of the professional CFL in 1958. The latest, the 106th Grey Cup, took place in <ENT>West Edmonton<ENT> , Alberta, on November 25, 2018, when the Calgary Stampeders defeated the Ottawa Redblacks 27–16.
Westminster<SEP>Much of the area in Vauxhall contains light industry, offices, and government buildings. Many companies and organisations were attracted in the past by Vauxhall's central location and comparatively cheap rent compared to <ENT>Westminster<ENT> on the other side of the river. In recent years, Vauxhall's riverside has undergone major redevelopment with the construction of a number of modern residential and office blocks, most notably the distinctive SIS Building at Vauxhall Cross. Also, a number of new commercial businesses have moved  into the area including Bathstore, Topps Tiles, Apolaki Krav Maga, and Dirty Boxing and Metropolis Motorcycles, as well as proposals to redevelop the Sainsburys site.
Le Havre<SEP>The only patrol over the Channel was the routine dawn patrol by Fighter Command from Ostend, south to the mouth of the Somme, which the Brest Group passed at 10:00 a.m. From 8:25–9:59 a.m. RAF radar operators under Squadron Leader Bill Igoe, using an un-jammed radar frequency, noticed four plots of German aircraft circling in places north of <ENT>Le Havre<ENT> , which at first were thought to be air-sea rescue operations. At 10:00 a.m. 11 Group RAF Fighter Command realised that the plots were moving north-east at 20–25 kn (23–29 mph; 37–46 km/h) and sent two Supermarine Spitfires to reconnoitre at 10:20 a.m., about the time that news reached Fighter Command headquarters that radar-jamming had begun at 9:20 a.m. and that the station at Beachy Head was detecting surface ships. Radar stations in Kent reported two large ships off Le Touquet at 10:52 a.m. and when the Spitfire patrol landed at 10:50 a.m. having kept radio silence, the pilots reported a flotilla off Le Touquet (near Boulogne) but not the capital ships.
Frome<SEP>Tanner was born in <ENT>Frome<ENT> , Somerset, the eldest son of Joseph Tanner. He was educated at Mill Hill School, London, and at St John's College, Cambridge, where he took a First in the Historical Tripos in 1882. He was President of the Cambridge Union Society in Easter Term, 1883. He was a lecturer in History at St John's, from 1883 to 1921, and lecturer on Indian History to Indian Civil Service students, from 1885 to 1893.
Arkansas<SEP>Corridor 18 was extended southwest to Houston, where it connected to Corridor 20, by the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1993; the new definition read "Corridor from Indianapolis, Indiana, through Evansville, Indiana, Memphis, Tennessee, Shreveport/Bossier, Louisiana, and to Houston, Texas." The National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 made further amendments to the description of Corridor 18, specifying that it would serve Mississippi and <ENT>Arkansas<ENT> , extending it south to the Mexican border in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, and adding a short connection at Brownsville, Texas. This act also specified that Corridors 18 and 20 were "future parts of the Interstate System", to become actual Interstates when built to Interstate standards and connected to other Interstates. Although the act designated Corridor 9 as I-99, no number was assigned to Corridors 18 and 20 yet.
Covent Garden<SEP>"I am Jon Marsh, founder member of the Beloved. Should you too wish to do something gorgeous, meet me in exactly three year's time at exactly 11am in Diana's Diner, or site thereof, <ENT>Covent Garden<ENT> , London, WC2."
Maryland<SEP>John Wilkes Booth (May 10, 1838 – April 26, 1865) was an American actor who assassinated President Abraham Lincoln at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. on April 14, 1865. He was a member of the prominent 19th-century Booth theatrical family from <ENT>Maryland<ENT> and a well-known actor in his own right. He was also a Confederate sympathizer, vehement in his denunciation of Lincoln, and strongly opposed to the abolition of slavery in the United States.
Wakefield<SEP>Aston was born in Castleford, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, he started playing rugby union at the age of eight in his home town of Castleford. He played one or two games but decided to switch to rugby league. He moved on to Stanley Rangers, in <ENT>Wakefield<ENT> , then after a couple of years until the age of fifteen at Oulton Raiders, where his father; Brian Aston had played as an amateur. He then moved to Lock Lane for one season, then started playing at Under-17 level for Castleford. Despite an offer of a professional contract with his home town club, he decided to accept an offer from Sheffield Eagles. At that point he had been playing open age rugby for Selby Gaffers, coached by his father Brian, and had made his first Eagles appearance as an unnamed trialist on Easter Day 1985.
Southam<SEP>The house at Burtscheid (Aachen) became the German secretariate of the society of the Holy Childhood. The influence of the empress delayed the expulsion of the congregation during the Kulturkampf until 1875, when steps were taken to close the houses in Prussia; but not until 1878 was the motherhouse at Aachen transferred to Simpelveld, a few miles over the Dutch frontier. Franz Bock supported the Sisters in their new workshop in the Netherlands and it flourished. There Bishop Jean-Théodore Laurent, who had resigned his see, took up his residence, and remained as counsellor until his death in 1884. The exiles found refuge in the Netherlands, Bavaria, Belgium, Luxemburg, and Austria. In England a house was established in 1876 at <ENT>Southam<ENT> , where an orphanage was immediately opened by the ten exiles who arrived there. The relaxation of the Falk Laws enabled the congregation in 1887 to regain many of its convents.
Kyoto<SEP>The area around Nakatsugawa was part of traditional Mino Province.  During the Edo period, much of the area was under the  control of Owari Domain, Naegi Domain and Iwamura Domain, or was tenryō under direction control of the Tokugawa shogunate. Nakatsugawa-juku prospered as one of the 69 Stations of the Nakasendō along the Nakasendō highway connecting Edo with <ENT>Kyoto<ENT> .  In the post-Meiji restoration cadastral reforms, Ena District in Gifu prefecture was created, and Nakatsugawa was proclaimed a town per the April 1, 1897 establishment of the modern municipalities system. Nakatsugawa merged with the town of Naegi in 1951 and was elevated to city status on April 1, 1952. Nakatsugawa annexed the village of Nakamoto in 1954, Ochiai in 1956, and Agi in 1957. On February 13, 2005, the towns of Tsukechi, Fukuoka and Sakashita and the villages of Hirukawa, Kashimo and Kawaue (all from the former Ena District), and the village of Yamaguchi (from Kiso District, Nagano Prefecture) were merged into Nakatsugawa.
Newcastle<SEP>The town later became an important centre for railway manufacturing. An early railway works was the Hopetown Carriage Works (est.1853) which supplied carriages and locomotives to the Stockton and Darlington Railway. The engineering firm of William and Alfred Kitching also manufactured locomotives in the 19th century. The town developed to have three significant works; the largest of these was the main line Darlington Works, whose main works were known as the North Road Shops which opened in 1863 and closed in 1966. Another was Robert Stephenson & Co. (colloquially: "Stivvies"), who moved to Darlington from <ENT>Newcastle<ENT> in 1902, became Robert Stephensons & Hawthorns in 1937, were absorbed by English Electric around 1960, and closed by 1964. The third was Faverdale Wagon Works, established in 1923 and closed in 1962, which in the 1950s was a UK pioneer in the application of mass-production techniques to the manufacture of railway goods wagons.
Blackpool<SEP>He was first Mayor of the Borough of Beckenham, Kent, within which he had settled at Shortlands, in 1935. He was made an honorary Freeman of the same borough in 1936 and of <ENT>Blackpool<ENT> in 1937. In 1936, he served as President of the Geographical Association, his brother L Dudley Stamp, also later became President of the GA in 1950 - the only brothers to hold this honour.
Sheffield<SEP>In March 1995, the group parted from Heart Management due to their frustration with the company's unwillingness to listen to their visions and ideas. To ensure they kept control of their own work, they allegedly stole the master recordings of their discography from the management offices. That same day, the group tracked down <ENT>Sheffield<ENT> -based producer Eliot Kennedy, who had been present at the showcase, and persuaded him to work with them. They were introduced to record producers Absolute, who in turn brought them to the attention of Simon Fuller of 19 Entertainment, who signed them to his company in March 1995. During the summer of that year, the group toured record labels in London and Los Angeles with Fuller, signing a deal with Virgin Records in September 1995. Their name was changed to Spice Girls, as a rapper was already using the name "Spice". From this point on until the summer of 1996, the group continued to write and record tracks for their debut album while extensively touring the west coast of the United States, where they signed a publishing deal with Windswept Pacific.
Edmonton<SEP>Vegreville /ˈvɛɡrəvɪl/ is a town in central Alberta, Canada located on Highway 16A approximately 103 km (64 mi) east of <ENT>Edmonton<ENT> , Alberta's capital city.  It was incorporated as a town in 1906,  and that year also saw the founding of the Vegreville Observer, a weekly newspaper for the region.
Leyte<SEP>The city was subjected to extensive bombing by forces led by Douglas MacArthur before American forces landed in <ENT>Leyte<ENT> in October 1944. The Battle of Davao towards the end of World War II was one of the longest and bloodiest battles during the Philippine Liberation, and brought tremendous destruction to the city, setting back the economic and physical strides made before the Japanese occupation.
Indy<SEP>Remington is located about 90 miles northwest of <ENT>Indy<ENT> and about 90 miles southeast of Chicago. It is about a mile west of Interstate 65; U.S. Route 24 and U.S. Route 231 pass through the town. Remington is located in the EST Time Zone.
Habbaniya<SEP>On 21 April 1938, the first Sunderland Mark 1 of the development batch conducted its first flight. By this point, manufacturer testing of the prototype had already been completed and the prototype had been transferred to the Seaplane Experimental Station at Felixstowe, Suffolk for its official evaluation by the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment (MAEE); on 8 March 1938, it was joined by the second production aircraft. On 28 May 1938, this second aircraft, which had been cleared for operations under tropical conditions, flew a record-breaking flight to Seletar, Singapore, stopping off along the route at Gibraltar, Malta, Alexandria, <ENT>Habbaniya<ENT> , Bahrain, Karachi, Gwalior, Calcutta, Rangoon, and Mergui.
Freiburg<SEP>The frescoes on the walls are vedute of the cities of the Austrian Habsburg monarchy, painted in 1565 by Giorgio Vasari for the wedding celebration of Francesco I de' Medici, the eldest son of Cosimo I de' Medici, to Archduchess Johanna of Austria, sister of the Emperor Maximilian II. Amongst the cities depicted are Graz, Innsbruck, Linz, Vienna, Bratislava (Poszony), Hall in Tirol, <ENT>Freiburg<ENT> and Konstanz. Some were damaged over the course of time.
Westminster<SEP>Once Wheeler's confession became apparent, the other members of the gang fled their usual haunts.  Turpin informed Gregory and the others of Wheeler's capture, and left <ENT>Westminster<ENT> . On 15 February 1735, while Wheeler was busy confessing to the authorities, "three or four men" (most likely Samuel Gregory, Herbert Haines, Turpin, and possibly Thomas Rowden) robbed the house of a Mrs St. John at Chingford.
Cardiff<SEP>During a brief call in India in 1885–86, 28-year-old Conrad sent five letters to Joseph Spiridion, a Pole eight years his senior whom he had befriended at <ENT>Cardiff<ENT> in June 1885 just before sailing for Singapore in the clipper ship Tilkhurst. These letters are Conrad's first preserved texts in English. His English is generally correct but stiff to the point of artificiality; many fragments suggest that his thoughts ran along the lines of Polish syntax and phraseology. More importantly, the letters show a marked change in views from those implied in his earlier correspondence of 1881–83. He had departed from "hope for the future" and from the conceit of "sailing [ever] toward Poland", and from his Panslavic ideas. He was left with a painful sense of the hopelessness of the Polish question and an acceptance of England as a possible refuge. While he often adjusted his statements to accord to some extent with the views of his addressees, the theme of hopelessness concerning the prospects for Polish independence often occurs authentically in his correspondence and works before 1914.
Kyoto<SEP>In <ENT>Kyoto<ENT> he found many of the influences that would ultimately shape him as a poet. He read Shinkichi Takahashi's Dadaist poetry, which shocked him into starting to write again. This artistic movement became a part of his poetic and life styles and later earned him the nickname “Dada-san”. In winter he met the actress Yasuko Hasegawa, three years his senior, and in April 1924 they began living together. It is also in this very year when Chūya became friends with fellow poet Tominaga Tarō. After completing Junior High School, Chūya and Yasuko decided to follow Tominaga to Tokyo, on the basis of attending university there. As he was unable to take the exam due to lack of documents or being late, he was sent out by his family on the condition that he would go to a preparatory school instead.
Kent<SEP>Stephen was born in the County of Blois in central France; his father, Count Stephen-Henry, died while Stephen was still young, and he was brought up by his mother, Adela, daughter of William the Conqueror. Placed into the court of his uncle, Henry I of England, Stephen rose in prominence and was granted extensive lands. He married Matilda of Boulogne, inheriting additional estates in <ENT>Kent<ENT> and Boulogne that made the couple one of the wealthiest in England. Stephen narrowly escaped drowning with Henry I's son, William Adelin, in the sinking of the White Ship in 1120; William's death left the succession of the English throne open to challenge. When Henry died in 1135, Stephen quickly crossed the English Channel and with the help of his brother Henry, Bishop of Winchester and Abbot of Glastonbury, took the throne, arguing that the preservation of order across the kingdom took priority over his earlier oaths to support the claim of Henry I's daughter, the Empress Matilda.
Okayama<SEP>Kishi was born Nobusuke Satō in Tabuse, Yamaguchi Prefecture, but left his family at a young age to move in with the more affluent Kishi family, adopting their family name. Kishi was considered to be so brilliant as a boy that one of his uncles thought it better to adopt him as he believed that his nephew could do much to advance the interests of the Kishi family. He attended an elementary school and middle school in <ENT>Okayama<ENT> , and then transferred to another middle school in Yamaguchi. His biological younger brother, Eisaku Satō, would also go on to become a prime minister. He is also the grandfather of the current prime minister of Japan Shinzō Abe. Kishi attended Tokyo Imperial University (now the University of Tokyo) and entered the Ministry of Commerce and Industry in 1920. As a young man, Kishi was a follower of the Japanese fascist Ikki Kita whose writings called for a sort of monarchical socialism for Japan.

Piraeus<SEP>The evolution of the Greek economy during the 19th century (a period that transformed a large part of the world because of the Industrial Revolution) has been little researched. Recent research from 2006 examines the gradual development of industry and further development of shipping in a predominantly agricultural economy, calculating an average rate of per capita GDP growth between 1833 and 1911 that was only slightly lower than that of the other Western European nations. Industrial activity, (including heavy industry like shipbuilding) was evident, mainly in Ermoupolis and <ENT>Piraeus<ENT> . Nonetheless, Greece faced economic hardships and defaulted on its external loans in 1826, 1843, 1860 and 1893.

Sialkot<SEP>Jawed Iqbal was born at <ENT>Sialkot<ENT> , Punjab, Pakistan. He has professional experience of 38 years. Jawed Iqbal is associated with Daily Jang, the Urdu language newspaper with the largest circulation within Pakistan and overseas. Jawed's approach is modern and cartoons fresh which is very hard to maintain for a cartoonist over three decades. Pakistan has very strict blasphemy laws and also a culture of political violence. Cartoonists in Pakistan have to be careful when making their cartoons. Still Pakistani cartoonists find ways to make fun of people in power and also the religious extremists. Jawed Iqbal says he does not make fun of religion and sex. Instead, his focus is on common man and his everyday problems. His cartoons are about rolling power outages, gas shortages and current political personalities. Jawed Iqbal also says that a cartoon should leave an instant impact on the viewer. He adds that a cartoonist has to sugarcoat a bitter fact and present it in a funny way to the public. Without offending people or humiliating them, a good cartoonist entertains and informs the public. This was the consensus view of a panel of Pakistani cartoonists in 2015 who met at Alhamra Arts Council, Lahore, Pakistan.
Oneonta<SEP>Springbrook is a not-for-profit organization located in <ENT>Oneonta<ENT> .

NRL is part of the Office of Naval Research. New Mexico State University, New Mexico Highlands University, the University of Puerto Rico, and Los Alamos National Laboratory were originally partners, but have since withdrawn.
Sheffield<SEP>Salford Museum and Art Gallery first opened in November 1850 as "The Royal Museum & Public Library", as the first unconditionally free public library in England. The library in Campfield, Manchester was the first library to operate a free lending library without subscription in 1852. Norwich lays claim to being the first municipality to adopt the Public Libraries Act 1850 (which allowed any municipal borough with a population of 100,000 or more to introduce a halfpenny rate to establish public libraries—although not to buy books). Norwich was the eleventh library to open, in 1857, after Winchester, Manchester, Liverpool, Bolton, Kidderminster, Cambridge, Birkenhead and <ENT>Sheffield<ENT> .

Wisconsin<SEP>Sheepshead is most commonly played in <ENT>Wisconsin<ENT> , where it is sometimes called the "unofficial" state card game. In 1983, it was declared the official card game of the city of Milwaukee. It is also common among German counties in Southern Indiana, which has large German-American populations, and on the internet.
Motherwell<SEP>During the summer of 2010, the band began work on their second EP, One More Second Chance. The majority of One More Second Chance was recorded in a church in <ENT>Motherwell<ENT> and was of a slightly heavier sound than their first EP. This led to comparisons between One More Second Chance and Blackened Sky by Biffy Clyro. In September 2010, the band headlined the O2 ABC Glasgow and released One More Second Chance. The band went on to support Elliot Minor and completed their first mini tour before the end of 2010.
Bradford<SEP>The valley has been inhabited since pre-historic times and there are two Iron Age sites overlooking the town.

Dachau<SEP>Waldeck-Pyrmont was arrested on 13 April 1945, and sentenced to life imprisonment by an American court at <ENT>Dachau<ENT> during the Buchenwald Trial on 14 August 1947. The first of the two successful charges against him alleged that he was personally responsible for crimes at Buchenwald, since the camp was located in his jurisdictional area, notwithstanding the fact that he was never in command of it, and that he even investigated the commandant of the camp for incitement to murder and embezzlement. The second charge was that he had ordered the execution of the Camp Commandant of Buchenwald, SS-Standartenführer Karl Otto Koch, after it was discovered Koch had disgraced both himself and the SS. Military Governor of Germany, General Lucius D. Clay ordered that the sentences of the Buchenwald Trial be re-examined on the basis of extensive records and, on 8 June 1948, confirmed fifteen of the death sentences and commuted seven. Most of the imprisonment sentences were also commuted, including Waldeck-Pyrmont's (from life to twenty years). Waldeck-Pyrmont was taken to Landsberg am Lech, where he served only three years of his sentence before being released in December 1950 for health reasons. He was granted an amnesty by the Minister President of Hesse in July 1953, which resulted in a significant reduction of the fine imposed on him.
Avellino<SEP>Under Zotto's successors, the duchy was expanded against the Byzantine Empire. Arechis, himself from the duchy of Friuli, captured Capua and Crotone, and sacked Byzantine Amalfi, but was unable to capture Naples. After his reign, Byzantine holdings in southern Italy were reduced to Naples, Amalfi, Gaeta, Sorrento, Calabria, and the maritime cities of Apulia (Bari, Brindisi, Otranto, etc.). In 662, Duke Grimoald I (duke since 647), went north to aid the King Godepert against his brother, the co-king Perctarit, and instead killed the former, forced the latter into exile, and captured Pavia. As king of the Lombards, he tried to reinstate Arianism over the Catholicism of the late king Aripert I. However, Arianism was disappearing even in the duchy, as was the distinction between the ethnic Lombard population and the Latin- and Greek-speaking one. In 663, the city itself was besieged by the Byzantines during the failed attempt of Constans II, who had disembarked at Taranto, to recover southern Italy. Duke Romuald I defended the city bravely, however, and the Emperor, also fearing the arrival of Romuald's father, King Grimoald, retired to Naples. However, Romuald intercepted part of the Roman army at Forino, between <ENT>Avellino<ENT> and Salerno, and destroyed it. A peace between the Duchy and the Eastern Empire was signed in 680.
Carnarvon<SEP>Dyffryn Nantlle was one of the major slate quarrying regions of Wales during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, having at least 37 operating slate quarries at one given time. It was an innovative region in the development of the slate industry. The Cilgwyn quarry on the north side of the valley is the oldest in Wales and one of the oldest in Europe, dating from the 12th century. The first steam engine to be used in the slate industry was a pump installed at the Hafodlas quarry in the valley in 1807. Slate roofing tiles have been excavated at Segontium Roman camp in <ENT>Carnarvon<ENT> and are thought to have originated in the Nantlle Valley. The quarries of the area are being considered as a World Heritage site.

Rochester<SEP>Six Mile Grove is a five-piece alternative country band based in <ENT>Rochester<ENT> .
Irish independence<SEP>Formerly, there were separate Chancellors of England, Scotland and Ireland.  When the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland united to form the Kingdom of Great Britain under the Act of Union 1707 the offices of the Chancellor of England and the Lord Chancellor of Scotland were combined to form a single office of Lord Chancellor  for the new state. Similar provision was not made when Great Britain and Ireland merged into the United Kingdom under the Act of Union 1800.  Thus, the separate office of Lord Chancellor of Ireland continued to exist until the formation of <ENT>Irish independence<ENT> in 1922. The office of Lord Chancellor of Ireland was abolished, and its duties transferred to the Governor of Northern Ireland, and later the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Thus, the Lord Chancellor remains "Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain", and not "Lord High Chancellor of the United Kingdom."
Fredericksburg<SEP>George Boxley married Hannah in <ENT>Fredericksburg<ENT> , and they had 11 children together, some born after they left the South. While some were young adults when Boxley arrived in Indiana, the youngest among them were born in his years on the run. His youngest child became the first recorded death in the township: Benjamin Boxley was killed by a tree that fell on him during a severe thunderstorm.
Rolla<SEP>Born the oldest of four children in Detroit, Michigan, Cowan's family moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where he began his education attending public schools.

Travnik<SEP>In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ćevapi, as they are known, have been a part of national cuisine for several centuries, however they were not widely commercialized before 1956, when the first ćevabdžinica was opened by a football player at that time, Asim Ferhatović. Bosnian version of Ćevapi is strictly made of veal, beef and lamb, together with basic spices, in any combination or amount. Most prominent Ćevapi in Bosnia and Herzegovina are from Sarajevo, <ENT>Travnik<ENT> and Banja Luka (originating from Bosanski Glamoč).
Ramsgate<SEP>There are a number of memorials which commemorate places where Fry lived. There are plaques located at her birthplace of Gurney Court in Norwich; her childhood home of Earlham Hall; St. Mildred's Court, City of London, where she lived when she was first married; and Arklow House, her final home and place of death in <ENT>Ramsgate<ENT> .

Hitchin<SEP>Bessemer's father, Anthony, was born in London into a Huguenot family, but moved to Paris when he was 21 years old. He was an inventor who, while engaged by the Paris Mint, made a machine for making medallions that could produce steel dies from a larger model. He became a member of the French Academy of Science, for his improvements to the optical microscope when he was 26. He was forced to leave Paris by the French Revolution, and returned to Britain. There he invented a process for making gold chains, which was successful, and enabled him to buy a small estate in the village of Charlton, near <ENT>Hitchin<ENT> in Hertfordshire, where Henry was born. According to Bessemer he was given his name by his godfather Henry Caslon, who employed his father as a punchcutter.
North Dakota<SEP>Saskatchewan is bordered on the west by Alberta, on the north by the Northwest Territories, on the east by Manitoba, to the northeast by Nunavut, and on the south by the U.S. states of Montana and <ENT>North Dakota<ENT> . As of Q3 2019, Saskatchewan's population was estimated at 1,174,462. Residents primarily live in the southern prairie half of the province, while the northern boreal half is mostly forested and sparsely populated. Of the total population, roughly half live in the province's largest city Saskatoon, or the provincial capital Regina. Other notable cities include Prince Albert, Moose Jaw, Yorkton, Swift Current, North Battleford, Melfort, and the border city Lloydminster (partially within Alberta).
Southampton<SEP>Football was introduced to Bilbao by two distinct groups with British connections; British workers and Basque students returning from schools in Britain. In the late 19th century, Bilbao was a leading industrial town and attracted many migrant workers, including miners from the north-east of England, and shipyard workers from <ENT>Southampton<ENT> , Portsmouth and Sunderland. They brought with them the game of football, and came together to form Bilbao Football Club. Meanwhile, sons of the Basque educated classes went to Britain to complete their studies, developed an interest in football and on their return began to arrange games with British workers. In 1898, students founded the Athletic Club, using the English spelling.
Boston<SEP>Largely due to the support of psychologist William James, the American Society for Psychical Research (ASPR) opened its doors in <ENT>Boston<ENT> in 1885, moving to New York City in 1905 under the leadership of James H. Hyslop. Notable cases investigated by Walter Franklin Prince of the ASPR in the early 20th century included Pierre L. O. A. Keeler, the Great Amherst Mystery and Patience Worth.
Derry<SEP>Saint Columba (Irish: Colm Cille, 'church dove'; Scots: Columbkille; 7 December 521 – 9 June 597) was an Irish abbot and missionary Evangelist credited with spreading Christianity in what is today Scotland at the start of the Hiberno-Scottish mission. He founded the important abbey on Iona, which became a dominant religious and political institution in the region for centuries. He is the Patron Saint of <ENT>Derry<ENT> . He was highly regarded by both the Gaels of Dál Riata and the Picts, and is remembered today as a Catholic saint and one of the Twelve Apostles of Ireland.
Torquay<SEP>He married Anne, daughter of Bolton Waller, of Shannon Grove and Castletown on 15 January 1835.

Another daughter, Jane Diana, married Rev. C.W. Furse in 1859. Through his son William Thomas Monsell, a magistrate and inspector of facturers, Monsell was grandfather to the artist Elinor Darwin (née Monsell).
New York<SEP>Hofstadter was born in <ENT>New York<ENT> , the son of Nobel Prize-winning physicist Robert Hofstadter and Nancy Givan Hofstadter. He grew up on the campus of Stanford University, where his father was a professor, and he attended the International School of Geneva in 1958–1959. He graduated with Distinction in Mathematics from Stanford University in 1965, and received his Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Oregon in 1975, where his study of the energy levels of Bloch electrons in a magnetic field led to his discovery of the fractal known as the Hofstadter butterfly.
Rijeka<SEP>The territory of the medieval Patriarchate of Aquileia had gradually been conquered by the Republic of Venice (Domini di Terraferma) until the early 15th century. In the east, the Habsburg archdukes of Austria, based on the March of Carniola they held from 1335, had gained suzerainty over Istrian Pazin in 1374 and the port of Trieste in 1382. They also purchased Duino and <ENT>Rijeka<ENT> (Fiume) on the northern Adriatic coast in 1474, and inherited more territory in Friuli when the line of the Counts of Görz died out in 1500. In 1511, Emperor Maximilian I annexed the city of Gradisca from Venice.
Sheffield<SEP>The design included elements representing Manchester (gules ... three bendlets enhanced ... or); <ENT>Sheffield<ENT> (eight arrows saltirewise banded); Lincoln (gules ... a fleur de lis or); Leicester (two wings); and London (Argent ... a cross gules ... daggers erect). Also represented was Mercury (a morion winged [sable]). It was used on locomotives and coaches.
Augsburg<SEP>Stauffenberg's full name was Claus Philipp Maria Justinian, followed by the noble title of "Count of Stauffenberg". He was born in the Stauffenberg castle of Jettingen between Ulm and <ENT>Augsburg<ENT> , in the eastern part of Swabia, at that time in the Kingdom of Bavaria, part of the German Empire.

Gifu<SEP>Shōkawa (荘川村, Shōkawa-mura) was a village located in Ōno District, <ENT>Gifu<ENT> , Japan.
Yerevan<SEP>The first true khachkars appeared in the 9th century, during the time of Armenian revival after liberation from Arab rule. The oldest khachkar with a known date was carved in 879 (though earlier, cruder, examples exist). Erected in Garni, it is dedicated to queen Katranide I, the wife of king Ashot I Bagratuni. The peak of the khachkar carving art was between the 12th and the 14th centuries. The art declined during the Mongol invasion at the end of the 14th century. It revived in the 16th and 17th centuries, but the artistic heights of the 14th century were never achieved again. Today, the tradition still remains, and one can still see khachkar carvers in some parts of <ENT>Yerevan<ENT> .
Battle of Kortrijk<SEP>The weapon was used to great effect by the guildsmen of Flanders' wealthy cities against the French knights at the Battle of the Golden Spurs near <ENT>Battle of Kortrijk<ENT> (Courtrai) on 11 July 1302. The goedendag is frequently seen in the hands of Flemish militia in contemporary depictions of the battle, such as the carvings on the Courtrai Chest, a 14th-century wooden chest. It is also seen on a now-faded fresco from the Leugemeete in Ghent.
Sheffield<SEP>In March 1838 James was making a journey by coach from <ENT>Sheffield<ENT> to York in a snowstorm, when he spied some ironwork furnaces in the distance.  The coachman informed him that they were managed by a Mr. Hartop who was one of his customers.  He immediately got off the coach and headed for the furnaces through the deep snow.  He found Mr. Hartop at his house, and was invited to stay the night and visit the works the next day.  That evening he met Hartop's family and was immediately smitten by his 21-year-old daughter, Anne.  A decisive man, the next day he told her of his feelings and intentions, which was received "in the best spirit that I could desire."  He then communicated the same to her parents, and told them his prospects, and so became betrothed in the same day. They were married two years later, on 16 June 1840 in Wentworth.
Brescia<SEP>Throughout his career his works display an internal oscillation between the traditions of the Venetian and Central Italian schools. Simultaneously he looked at the form and colour of Venetian artists such as Titian and Palma the Elder whilst his classicising, sweet intensity earned him the name "Raphael of <ENT>Brescia<ENT> ". Though there is some uncertainty regarding his studio, he took on a number of pupils the most important of whom was the portraitist Giovanni Battista Moroni. He also influenced Callisto Piazza.

Minnesota<SEP>Moody County lies on the east side of South Dakota. Its east boundary line abuts the west boundary line of the state of <ENT>Minnesota<ENT> . The Big Sioux River flows southerly through the center of the county. Its terrain consists of rolling hills, devoted to agriculture, with lakes in the western portion. The terrain slopes to the south, with its high point near its NE corner, at 1,749' (533m) ASL, although the east and west sides also slope into the river valley through the center of the county. The county has a total area of 521 square miles (1,350 km), of which 519 square miles (1,340 km) is land and 1.4 square miles (3.6 km) (0.3%) is water.
Congo<SEP>Although the West had had a presence in Africa for centuries, its colonies were limited mostly to Africa's coast. Europeans, including the Britons Mungo Park and David Livingstone, the German Johannes Rebmann, and the Frenchman René Caillié, explored the interior of the continent, allowing greater European expansion in the later 19th century. The period between 1870 and 1914 is often called the Scramble for Africa, due to the competition between European nations for control of Africa. In 1830, France occupied Algeria in North Africa. Many Frenchman settled on Algeria's Mediterranean coast. In 1882 Britain annexed Egypt. France eventually conquered most of Morocco and Tunisia as well. Libya was conquered by the Italians. Spain gained a small part of Morocco and modern-day Western Sahara. West Africa was dominated by France, although Britain ruled several smaller West African colonies. Germany also established two colonies in West Africa, and Portugal had one as well. Central Africa was dominated by <ENT>Congo<ENT> . At first the colony was ruled by Belgium's king, Leopold II, however his regime was so brutal the Belgian government took over the colony. The Germans and French also established colonies in Central Africa. The British and Italians were the two dominant powers in East Africa, although France also had a colony there. Southern Africa was dominated by Britain. Tensions between the British Empire and the Boer republics led to the Boer Wars, fought on and off between the 1880s and 1902, ending in a British victory. In 1910 Britain united its South African colonies with the former Boer republics and established the Union of South Africa, a dominion of the British Empire. The British established several other colonies in Southern Africa. The Portuguese and Germans also established a presence in Southern Africa. The French conquered the island of Madagascar. By 1914, Africa had only two independent nations, Liberia, a nation founded in West Africa by free black Americans earlier in the 19th century, and the ancient kingdom of Ethiopia in East Africa. Many Africans, like the Zulus, resisted European rule, but in the end Europe succeeded in conquering and transforming the continent. Missionaries arrived and established schools, while industrialists helped establish rubber, diamond and gold industries on the continent. Perhaps the most ambitious change by Europeans was the construction of the Suez Canal in Egypt, allowing ships to travel from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean without having to go all the way around Africa.

Lyme<SEP>The New York to New Haven line has long been completely grade-separated, and the last grade crossings between Washington and New York were eliminated in the 1980s. In 1994, during planning for electrification and high-speed Acela Express service between New Haven and Boston, a law was passed requiring USDOT to plan for the elimination of all remaining crossings (unless impractical or unnecessary) by 1997. Some lightly used crossings were simply closed, while most were converted into bridges or underpasses. Only thirteen remained by 1999, of which lightly used crossings in <ENT>Lyme<ENT> and Exeter, Rhode Island were soon closed.
Cecil<SEP>Paw Paw Building, also known as Odd Fellows Hall, is a historic building located at Port Deposit, <ENT>Cecil<ENT> . It is a two-story, 36-by-40-foot (11 by 12 m), stone structure covered with plaster, that was built in 1821 by the First Methodist Episcopal congregation.  It was used as a church until 1839.  It was then used as a school called Heath of Health Academy and later Odd Fellows Academy.  It later held a grocery store and "dining salon" until converted for use as an apartment and recreation hall.

Kandahar<SEP>During his January 1989 visit to Shevardnadze Najibullah wanted to retain a small presence of Soviet troops in Afghanistan, and called for moving Soviet bombers to military bases close to the Afghan–Soviet border and place them on permanent alert. Najibullah also repeated his claims that his government could not survive if Massoud remained alive. Shevardnadze again repeated that troops could not stay, since it would lead to international outcry, but said he would look into the matter. Shevardnadze demanded that the Soviet embassy created a plan in which at least 12,000 Soviet troops would remain in Afghanistan either under direct control of the United Nations or remain as "volunteers". The Soviet military leadership, when hearing of Shevardnadze's plan, became furious. But they followed orders, and named the operation Typhoon, maybe ironic considering that Operation Typhoon was the German military operation against the city of Moscow during World War II. Shevardnadze contacted the Soviet leadership about moving a unit to break the siege of <ENT>Kandahar<ENT> , and to protect convoys from and to the city. The Soviet leadership were against Shevardnadze's plan, and Chernyaev even believed it was part of Najibullah's plan to keep Soviet troops in the country. To which Shevardnadze replied angrily "You've not been there, [...] You've no idea all the things we have done there in the past ten years." At a Politburo meeting on 24 January, Shevardnadze argued that the Soviet leadership could not be indifferent to Najibullah and his government; again, Shevardnadze received support from Kryuchkov. In the end Shevardnadze lost the debate, and the Politburo reaffirmed their commitment to withdraw from Afghanistan. There was still a small presence of Soviet troops after the Soviet withdrawal; for instance, parachutists who protected the Soviet embassy staff, military advisors and special forces and reconnaissance troops still operated in the "outlying provinces", especially along the Afghan–Soviet border.
Kut<SEP>At first, the Georgian troops deployed for Operation Iraqi Freedom were stationed in Baghdad and provided general security measures. Beginning in 2007, the Georgians were deployed along the border with Iran, with their main base at <ENT>Kut<ENT> , and tasked to interdict smuggled weapons, goods, and drugs. The Georgian units worked primarily within the U.S. area of operations. In total, more than 6,000 Georgian soldiers served in Iraq on the basis of six-month rotations; the service in Iraq was voluntary.

Pisa<SEP>While the earliest account of a botanical garden was in <ENT>Pisa<ENT> in 1543, the first discovered English botanical garden was in Oxford in 1621. Near London, the gardens at Kew was established in 1759. August, dowager princess of Wales worked with well-known botanists of the time, Lord Bute and Stephen Hales, to greatly expand the garden with exotic plants. By 1769, Kew Gardens contained over 3,400 variations of plants.
Nairobi<SEP>In <ENT>Nairobi<ENT> , Kenya, the Thorn Tree Café is named after a Naivasha thorn tree (Acacia xanthophloea) in its centre. Travelers used to pin notes to others to the thorns of the tree. The current tree is the third of the same variety.
Missouri<SEP>Twenty one states (Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, <ENT>Missouri<ENT> , Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin) do not allow persons convicted of a felony to vote while serving a sentence, but automatically restore the franchise to the person upon completion of a sentence. In Iowa, in July 2005, Governor Tom Vilsack issued an executive order restoring the right to vote for all persons who have completed supervision, which the Iowa Supreme Court upheld on October 31, 2005.

Arkansas<SEP>Oklahoma (/ˌoʊkləˈhoʊmə/ (listen); Cherokee: ᎣᎦᎳᎰᎹ, ogalahoma; Choctaw: Oklahumma) is a state in the South Central region of the United States, bordered by Kansas on the north, Missouri on the northeast, <ENT>Arkansas<ENT> on the east, Texas on the south and west, New Mexico on the west, and Colorado on the northwest. It is the 20th-most extensive and the 28th-most populous of the 50 United States. The state's name is derived from the Choctaw words okla and humma, meaning "red people". It is also known informally by its nickname, "The Sooner State", in reference to the non-Native settlers who staked their claims on land before the official opening date of lands in the western Oklahoma Territory or before the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889, which increased European-American settlement in the eastern Indian Territory. Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged into the State of Oklahoma when it became the 46th state to enter the union on November 16, 1907. Its residents are known as Oklahomans (or colloquially, "Okies"), and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City.
Walla Walla<SEP>At the southeast corner of the Army depot near Hermiston in Umatilla County, I-84 intersects the southern terminus of I-82, a freeway connecting northeastern Oregon to Washington's Tri-Cities, Yakima, and I-90. The freeway goes on to intersect OR 27 south of Hermiston and US 395 near Stanfield, forming a concurrency with the latter. From Stanfield, I-84, US 30, and US 395 continue southeast along the Umatilla River and the old Oregon Trail to Pendleton, which lies in a valley formed by the river. West of the city, near the Eastern Oregon Regional Airport, US 30 leaves the concurrency to run through downtown on city streets. After passing the Eastern Oregon Correctional Institution and crossing the river, US 395 splits from I-84 at Southgate, heading south towards John Day. I-84 continues around the south edge of Pendleton and intersects OR 11, a connecting highway to <ENT>Walla Walla<ENT> , before being rejoined by US 30. The freeway travels southeast through a portion of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, passing the on-reservation resort casino, and begins its ascent into the Blue Mountains.

However he lost regular position for injury in 1996, and his opportunity to play decreased from 1997. He could not play at all in the matches from 1999. He retired with rival Takita end of 2000 season.
Isle of Wight<SEP>Although negotiations with the lords of Ireland were unsuccessful, Owain had reason to hope that the French and Bretons might be more welcoming. He dispatched Gruffydd Young and his brother-in-law (Margaret's brother), John Hanmer, to negotiate with the French. The result was a formal treaty that promised French aid to Owain and the Welsh. The immediate effect seems to have been that joint Welsh and Franco-Breton forces attacked and laid siege to Kidwelly Castle. The Welsh could also count on semi-official fraternal aid from their fellow Celts in the then independent Brittany and Scotland. Scots and French privateers were operating around Wales throughout Owain's war. Scottish ships had raided English settlements on the Llŷn Peninsula in 1400 and 1401. In 1403, a Breton squadron defeated the English in the Channel and devastated Jersey, Guernsey and Plymouth, while the French made a landing on <ENT>Isle of Wight<ENT> . By 1404, they were raiding the coast of England, with Welsh troops on board, setting fire to Dartmouth and devastating the coast of Devon.
Liverpool<SEP>With some interruptions, the Bluesbreakers have continued to tour and release albums (over 50 to date), though they never achieved the critical or popular acclaim of their earlier material. In 2003, Eric Clapton, Mick Taylor and Chris Barber reunited with the band for John Mayall's 70th Birthday Concert in <ENT>Liverpool<ENT> —the concert was later released on CD and DVD. In 2004, their lineup included Buddy Whittington, Joe Yuele, Hank Van Sickle and Tom Canning, and the band toured the UK with Mick Taylor as a guest musician.
Fulham<SEP>Alesha Dixon and Sabrina Washington met in 1997 at Dance Attic studios in <ENT>Fulham<ENT> through Louise Porter, who was putting together a group for her production company Big Out Ltd. The two worked with Louise Porter for a couple of years before being joined by Tina Barrett to form a trio performing singing and dancing. They were named Face2Face, were unsigned, and all band members still worked day jobs. Barrett left to join S Club 7 after a successful audition for Simon Fuller and was replaced by Zena McNally and Su-Elise Nash. Their then producer David Brant (writer of their first two hit singles, "Why?" and "All I Want") introduced them via DJ Darren Stokes (TinTinOut) to Inferno Records (sub pop) A&R man Pat Travers, who went on to sign them to Telstar Records and changed their name to Mis-Teeq. After months of recording—including sessions with producers Norwegian duo Stargate along with Brant (Vybrant Music), Ed Case, Blacksmith, Rishi Rich, and Ceri Evans—Mis-Teeq released their debut single in 2000, "Why?", a Latin-flavoured mid-tempo song co-written and produced by Brant. A garage remix by Matt "Jam" Lamont soon became a success in the underground UK garage scene, and as a result a second music video for the song was filmed and released. "Why" became a hit on the UK Singles Chart with a peak position of number eight. McNally decided to leave the line-up in spring 2001 saying she felt unhappy about "an unbalance in the group".
Mysore<SEP>In 2004, Simputers were used by the government of Karnataka to automate the process of land records procurement.  Simputers were also used in an ambitious project in Chhattisgarh for the purpose of e-education. In 2005, they were used in a variety of applications, such as automobile engine diagnostics (Mahindra & Mahindra in Mumbai), tracking of iron-ore movement from mine pithead to shipping point (Dempo, Goa), Microcredit (Sanghamitra, <ENT>Mysore<ENT> ), Electronic Money Transfer between UK and Ghana (XK8 Systems, UK), and others. In recent times, the Simputer has seen deployment by the police force to track traffic offenders and issue traffic tickets.

In Ireland, Fanque's circus performed at Dublin, Belfast, Cork, Galway, Ballinasloe, Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, and Clonmel, among other places. In Cork, in 1850, Fanque built an amphitheatre on the site of the former Theatre Royal, where the current General Post Office stands (built in 1877). His circus also performed at the Donnybrook Fair in 1850, five years before the centuries' old fair was discontinued.
Congo<SEP>In November 1964, on the other side of the globe, C-130Es from the 464th Troop Carrier Wing but loaned to 322d Air Division in France, took part in Operation Dragon Rouge, one of the most dramatic missions in history in the <ENT>Congo<ENT> . After communist Simba rebels took white residents of the city of Stanleyville hostage, the U.S. and Belgium developed a joint rescue mission that used the C-130s to drop, air-land and air-lift a force of Belgian paratroopers to rescue the hostages. Two missions were flown, one over Stanleyville and another over Paulis during Thanksgiving weeks. The headline-making mission resulted in the first award of the prestigious MacKay Trophy to C-130 crews.
Wittenberg<SEP>What was true of the scholarship of Germany was also true of its art. The painters, Albrecht Dürer, who was born and died at Nuremberg, 1471–1528, Lucas Cranach the Elder, 1472–1553, and for the most part Hans Holbein the Younger, 1497–1543, took little interest in mythology, apart from Cranach's nudes, and were persuaded by the Reformation, though most continued to take commissions for traditional Catholic subjects.  Dürer and Holbein had close contacts with leading humanists.  Cranach lived in <ENT>Wittenberg<ENT> after 1504 and painted portraits of Martin Luther, Philip Melanchthon and other leaders of the German Reformation. Holbein made frontispieces and illustrations for Protestant books and painted portraits of Erasmus and Melanchthon.

Tortuga Island<SEP>The Florida Keys are a coral cay archipelago located off the southern coast of Florida, forming the southernmost part of the continental United States. They begin at the southeastern coast of the Florida peninsula, about 15 miles (24 km) south of Miami, and extend in a gentle arc south-southwest and then westward to Key West, the westernmost of the inhabited islands, and on to the <ENT>Tortuga Island<ENT> . The islands lie along the Florida Straits, dividing the Atlantic Ocean to the east from the Gulf of Mexico to the northwest, and defining one edge of Florida Bay. At the nearest point, the southern part of Key West is just 90 miles (140 km) from Cuba. The Florida Keys are between about 24.3 and 25.5 degrees North latitude.
Genoa<SEP>Bakunin returned to England in September and focussed on Polish affairs. When the Polish insurrection broke out in January 1863, he sailed to Copenhagen where he hoped to join the Polish insurgents. They planned to sail across the Baltic in the SS Ward Jackson to join the insurrection. This attempt failed, and Bakunin met his wife in Stockholm before returning to London. Now he focussed again on going to Italy and his friend Aurelio Saffi wrote him letters of introduction to revolutionaries in Florence, Turin, and Milan. Mazzini wrote him letters of commendation to Federico Campanella in <ENT>Genoa<ENT> and Giuseppe Dolfi in Florence. Bakunin left London in November 1863, travelled by way of Brussels, Paris and, Vevey, Switzerland, and arrived in Italy on 11 January 1864. It was here that he first began to develop his anarchist ideas. Bakunin conceived the plan of forming a secret organization of revolutionaries to carry on propaganda work and prepare for direct action. He recruited Italians, Frenchmen, Scandinavians, and Slavs into the International Brotherhood, also called the Alliance of Revolutionary Socialists.
Iwo Jima<SEP>Ashland headed for Cape Gloucester on 28 November for training exercises. Three days later, she got underway for Lingayen Gulf and the occupation of Luzon.

Currently, eight states (Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Missouri, Ohio, South Dakota, Texas, and Washington) have used the single-drug execution protocol. Five additional states ( <ENT>Arkansas<ENT> , Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina, and Tennessee) have announced that they are switching to a single-drug protocol but, as of April 2014, have not executed anyone since switching protocols.
Epsom<SEP>At just what point Rouse decided on his scheme is not settled, nor how he arrived at it, as following his arrest, Rouse gave several contradictory accounts as to just how and when he devised his plan. However, he did mention that initially, he had begun to think about committing a murder in which he could fake his own death after he had read reports of the murder of a young Scottish barmaid named Agnes Kesson, who had been found murdered in a rural lane in the market town of <ENT>Epsom<ENT> in June 1930, and whose murder would ultimately remain unsolved. Furthermore, he would claim the decision for him to ultimately decide to fake his own death had been Nellie Tucker's announcement to him in the summer of 1930 that she was expecting her second child by him (an illegitimate daughter would be born on 29 October).

Potsdam<SEP>On 8 April 2018, a 1.8-tonne bomb was defused in Paderborn, which caused the evacuation of more than 26,000 people. On 24 May 2018, a 550 lb (250 kg) bomb was defused in Dresden after the initial attempts of deactivation failed, and caused a small explosion. On 3 July 2018, a 550 lb (250 kg) bomb was disabled in <ENT>Potsdam<ENT> which caused 10,000 people to be evacuated from the region. In August 2018, 18,500 people in the city of Ludwigshafen had to be evacuated, in order to detonate a 1,100 lb (500 kg) bomb dropped by American forces.
Columbia<SEP>English was born and raised in <ENT>Columbia<ENT> . For some of his childhood, he and his siblings lived with their grandmother while their parents worked in New York. During this time, English often subsisted on a single meal per day.
Denver<SEP>Loveland is the Home Rule Municipality that is the second most populous municipality in Larimer County, Colorado, United States. Loveland is situated 46 miles (74 km) north of the Colorado State Capitol in <ENT>Denver<ENT> and is the 14th most populous city in Colorado. As of the 2010 census the population of Loveland was 66,859, and in 2018 the population was estimated at 77,446. The city forms part of the Fort Collins-Loveland Metropolitan Statistical Area and the Front Range Urban Corridor. The city's public schools are part of the Thompson R2-J School District.
Scunthorpe<SEP>The Clugston Group is a privately owned business involved in construction and civil engineering, property development and logistics. The group is based in <ENT>Scunthorpe<ENT> , North Lincolnshire in England.
Pittsburg<SEP>Shad Meier was drafted as the 90th overall pick of  the 2001 NFL Draft for Tennessee Titans. The 6 foot 4 inches, 255 pounds, from <ENT>Pittsburg<ENT> enjoyed a 6-year playing career in the NFL. He spent first four years of his NFL career with the Tennessee Titans. Meier was traded to the New Orleans Saints in 2004 before retiring in 2006.
Carcassonne<SEP>Gustave Fayet (Béziers, May 20, 1865 - <ENT>Carcassonne<ENT> , September 24, 1925) was a French painter. His work is close in style to that of Paul Gauguin or Odilon Redon. He learnt to draw and paint with his father, Gabriel Fayet, and his uncle Léon Fayet, who both admired pre-impressionnist painters such as Adolphe Monticelli or Camille Corot. Gustave Fayet's style is very personal, far from impressionism or academic work, rather more symbolism. Gustave Fayet was also an art collector, he owned works by Degas, Manet, Pissarro and above all Paul Gauguin. Fayet was in fact one of Gauguin's main clients and he lent many of the paintings in his collection for the Gauguin exhibitions between 1903 and 1925. In 1908, he brought the Abbaye de Fontfroide (near Narbonne, France), that he reconstructed and where he exhibited many of the paintings from his collection, among them "Day" and "Night" by Odilon Redon.
Cheltenham<SEP>Wootton Wawen railway station was opened in 1908 on a branch of the Great Western Railway. The route is now the Birmingham to Stratford Line. The line south of Stratford upon Avon railway station continued as the Honeybourne Line to Honeybourne railway station (which is on the Cotswold Line) and onwards to <ENT>Cheltenham<ENT> .
Indiana<SEP>Santa Claus is a town in Spencer County, <ENT>Indiana<ENT> , United States, in the southwestern part of the state.  Located in Carter, Clay and Harrison Townships, it sits between Interstate 64 and the Ohio River. The population was 2,481 at the 2010 census, making it the largest community in Spencer County.
Brighton<SEP>The development of <ENT>Brighton<ENT> as a fashionable resort in the 1780s increased the significance of Croydon's role as a halt for stage coaches on the road south of London. At the beginning of the 19th century, Croydon became the terminus of two pioneering commercial transport links with London. The first, opened in 1803, was the horse-drawn Surrey Iron Railway from Wandsworth, which in 1805 was extended to Merstham, as the Croydon, Merstham and Godstone Railway. The second, opened in 1809, was the Croydon Canal, which branched off the Grand Surrey Canal at Deptford. The London and Croydon Railway (an atmospheric and steam-powered railway) opened between London Bridge and West Croydon in 1839, using much of the route of the canal (which had closed in 1836). Other connections to London and the south followed.
Irish Republic<SEP>Women's suffrage developed as in Great Britain. In England and Wales, an 1894 act allowed women to vote for the local authorities established in 1888; the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 replicated both the 1888 authorities and the 1894 suffrage in Ireland. The Representation of the People Act 1918 allowed all men over 21 and most women over 30 to vote in parliamentary elections. The Second Dáil resolved to hold a general election in June 1922 for an assembly which would be both the Third Dáil of the soon-to-be- <ENT>Irish Republic<ENT> and a Provisional Parliament for the nascent Irish Free State. The republican minority wanted the franchise for this election to be equal for men and women, but the pro-Free State majority argued it was impractical and unlawful to change the 1918 franchise. Both sides were motivated by the belief that young women tended to be republican. The Second Dáil did agree that, if the post-election government, which was responsible to the new assembly, were to collapse, the consequent election would be on "Adult Suffrage".
Leipzig<SEP>The district was located in the triangle between the metropolises of <ENT>Leipzig<ENT> , Halle and Bitterfeld. It consists of plain countryside, which is mainly agriculturally used. There is low urbanisation throughout the district. The Mulde River runs through the easternmost part of the district. On the eastern banks there is the Düben Heath (Dübener Heide), a nature park extending from here to the east and to the north.
Irish independence<SEP>From the beginning, the party had a strong association with the Orange Order, a Protestant fraternal organisation. The original composition of the Ulster Unionist Council was 25% Orange delegates, however this was reduced through the years. Although most unionist support was based in the geographic area that became Northern Ireland, there were at one time unionist enclaves throughout southern Ireland. Unionists in County Cork and Dublin were particularly influential. The initial leadership of the Ulster Unionist Party all came from outside what would later become Northern Ireland; men such as Colonel Saunderson, Viscount (later the Earl of) Midleton and the Dubliner Edward Carson, all members of the Irish Unionist Alliance. However, after the Irish Convention failed to reach an understanding on home rule and with the partition of Ireland under the Government of Ireland Act 1920, Irish unionism in effect split. Many southern unionist politicians quickly became reconciled with the <ENT>Irish independence<ENT> , sitting in its Seanad or joining its political parties. The existence of a separate Ulster Unionist Party became entrenched as the party took control of the new government of Northern Ireland.
Maine<SEP>1992 was arguably a "realigning" election. It made the Democratic Party dominant in presidential elections in the Northeast, the Great Lakes region (until 2016) and the West Coast, where many states had previously either been swing states or Republican-leaning. Clinton picked up several states that went Republican in 1988, and which have remained in the Democratic column ever since: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, most of <ENT>Maine<ENT> (besides the state's second congressional district, which broke the state's total straight Democratic voting record since, when it voted for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in 2016), Maryland, New Jersey, and Vermont. Vermont, carried by Clinton, had been heavily Republican for generations prior to the election, voting for a Democrat only once (in 1964). The state has been won by the Democratic nominee in every presidential election since. Bill Clinton narrowly defeated Bush in New Jersey (by two points), which had voted for the Republican nominee all but twice since 1948. Clinton would later win the state in 1996 by eighteen points; like Vermont, Republicans have not won the state since. California, which had previously been a Republican stronghold from 1952 to 1988, was now solidly Democratic. Clinton, a lifelong Southerner, was able to carry several states in the South that the GOP had been winning for decades, but ultimately won only four of eleven former Confederate states. This reflected the final shift of the South to the Republican Party. This was also the last election where Colorado voted Democratic until 2008. The election was the last time that a member of either party won the presidency without winning Florida.
Andenes<SEP>Bleik is a fishing village in Andøy Municipality in Nordland county, Norway.  The village is located on the northwestern part of the island of Andøya, about 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) southwest of the village of <ENT>Andenes<ENT> .
Oak Ridge nuclear facility<SEP>The renovation of Oak Ridge High School in <ENT>Oak Ridge nuclear facility<ENT> has been partially funded by $8 million in QZABs. Matching funds to qualify for QZAB funding were provided through private donations.
Congo<SEP>Since that discovery, there have been many searches in terrestrial materials for natural sources of technetium. In 1962, technetium-99 was isolated and identified in pitchblende from <ENT>Congo<ENT> in extremely small quantities (about 0.2 ng/kg); there it originates as a spontaneous fission product of uranium-238. The Oklo natural nuclear fission reactor contains evidence that significant amounts of technetium-99 were produced and have since decayed into ruthenium-99.
Ohio<SEP>Lipscomb was born in Cleveland, <ENT>Ohio<ENT> . His family moved to Lexington, Kentucky in 1920, and he lived there until he received his Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry at the University of Kentucky in 1941. He went on to earn his Doctor of Philosophy degree in Chemistry from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1946.
Darfur<SEP>This is the area known as the Fombina, literally meaning "The South" in Adamawa Fulfulde, because it represented the most southern and eastern reaches of Fulɓe hegemonic dominance in West Africa. In this area, Fulfulde is the local lingua franca, and language of cross cultural communication. Further east of this area, Fulani communities become predominantly nomadic, and exist at less organized social systems. These are the areas of the Chari-Baguirmi Region and its river systems, in Chad and the Central African Republic, the Ouaddaï highlands of Eastern Chad, the areas around Kordofan, <ENT>Darfur<ENT> and the Blue Nile, Sennar, Kassala regions of Sudan, as well as the Red Sea coastal city of Port Sudan. The Fulani on their way to or back from the pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, settled in many parts of eastern Sudan, today representing a distinct community of over 2 million people referred to as the Fellata.
Haifa<SEP>Under Shoghi Effendi's direction, National Spiritual Assemblies were formed, and many thousands of Local Spiritual Assemblies were created. During the 1930s he worked on projects translating the works of Bahá'u'lláh into English. Starting in 1937, he set into motion a series of systematic plans to establish Bahá'í communities in all countries.  A Ten Year Crusade was carried out from 1953 to 1963 with the aim of electing the Universal House of Justice as its paramount aim. Starting in the late 1940s, after the establishment of the State of Israel, he started to develop the Bahá'í World Centre in <ENT>Haifa<ENT> , including the construction of the superstructure of the Shrine of the Báb and the building of the International Archives as well as beautifying the gardens at Bahji, where the Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh is located, as well as developing plans and resources to raise several of the continental Bahá'í Houses of Worship around the world; these plans continued through the 1950s.
Yamagata<SEP>Nozoki Station (及位駅, Nozoki eki) is a JR East railway station located in Mamurogawa, <ENT>Yamagata<ENT> , Japan.
Millbank<SEP>Crosse  married Mary Godfrey on 15 July 1746 at St John's, Westminster. They had no children and on his death at <ENT>Millbank<ENT> on 12 March 1762 the baronetcy became extinct. He was buried on 2 April 1762, at St Margaret's, Westminster. His widow was buried in the same church on  25 September 1770.
Boston<SEP>Meanwhile, numerous versions of Pinafore, unauthorised by its creators, began playing in America with great success, beginning with a production in <ENT>Boston<ENT> that opened on 25 November 1878. Pinafore became a source of popular quotations on both sides of the Atlantic, such as the exchange:
Cape Leeuwin<SEP>Margaret River is located 9 kilometres (6 mi) inland from the Indian Ocean at a point about halfway between Cape Naturaliste and <ENT>Cape Leeuwin<ENT> in Western Australia's South West region.
Ankara<SEP>The first attempt at a merger of BEA and BOAC arose in 1953 out of inconclusive attempts between the two airlines to negotiate air rights through the British colony of Cyprus. The Chairman of BOAC, Miles Thomas, was in favour of the idea as a potential solution to a disagreement between the two airlines as to which should serve the increasingly important oil regions of the Middle East, and he had backing for his proposal from the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time, Rab Butler. However, opposition from the Treasury blocked the idea, and an agreement was reached instead to allow BEA to serve <ENT>Ankara<ENT> in Turkey, and in return to leave all routes east and south of Cyprus to BOAC. Paradoxically, through its effective control of Cyprus Airways, BEA was able to continue to serve destinations ceded to BOAC, including Beirut and Cairo by using Cyprus Airways as its proxy.
Loughborough<SEP>The place name <ENT>Loughborough<ENT> uses two different pronunciations of ough: the first ough has the sound as in cuff and the second rhymes with thorough.
Aberdeen<SEP>The range of hills is a popular destination for walkers since it is relatively close to <ENT>Aberdeen<ENT> . The Gordon Way is a waymarked trail that traverses the Southern flank of Bennachie between the Visitors Centre in the East and Suie Car Park to the West. Most of the  Bennachie range is owned by Forestry and Land Scotland, which maintains a network of paths on and around the hills, several car parks and a visitor centre located at the eastern foot of the range. A volunteer group, the Bailies of Bennachie, founded in 1973, helps with this work and with other environmental and archaeological activities on the hill. There are several marked paths, including fairly easy ascents of Oxen Craig and Mither Tap that start from the centre.
Leyte<SEP>In a strategy conference in Pearl Harbor in July, President Franklin Roosevelt agreed with General Douglas MacArthur that the Philippines, an American territory, would be liberated and they set the date for 20 December. This required a series of preliminary operations to assault the Japanese bases in the western Caroline Islands and the approaches to the Philippines, including Yap and the Palaus. Mitscher began the process by taking three of his task groups, including Hornet's TG 38.1, to attack the Palaus on 6–8 September before moving further west to attack Mindanao on 9–10 September, the southernmost large island of the Philippines. Encouraged by the lack of opposition, Halsey ordered Mitscher to attack the central Philippine islands, including <ENT>Leyte<ENT> and the other Visayan Islands. Resistance was weak during the attacks on 12–13 September and the American pilots claimed 173 aircraft shot down, 305 destroyed on the ground and 59 ships sunk for the loss of 9 aircraft to all causes. The reality was slightly different, the First Air Fleet defending the central Philippines had a strength of 176 aircraft before the American attacks and 85 after them; the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force (IJAAF) lost 31–40 aircraft during the attacks.
Torquay<SEP>Fuller went back to Ramsbottom as professional in 1958, and made a single further first-class appearance at the end of the 1958 English cricket season as a member of a Commonwealth XI against an England XI in the festival at <ENT>Torquay<ENT> . In 1959, he switched to Rawtenstall for a final season of Lancashire League cricket.
Sheffield<SEP>The M67 is a 5-mile (8.0 km) urban motorway in Greater Manchester, England, which heads east from the M60 motorway passing through Denton and Hyde before ending near Mottram. It was originally conceived as the first part of a trans-Pennine motorway between Manchester and <ENT>Sheffield<ENT> connecting the A57(M) motorway to the M1 motorway; however, the motorway never progressed this far.
Wigan<SEP>The southern part of what became the traditional county of Lancashire was at least partially settled by the Brigantes, a Celtic tribe, who were subjugated by the Romans during their 1st Century conquest, with nearby <ENT>Wigan<ENT> suggested as a location for the Roman settlement of Coccium. Eccleston in St Helens appears to derive its name from either the Latin ecclesia or the Welsh eglwys, both meaning "church", suggesting a common link to a place of worship although none is known in that township until the 19th century.
West Edmonton<SEP>In July 2005, the group played a free concert in <ENT>West Edmonton<ENT> for the Klondike Days festival. In late 2005, Snider appeared on Numbers from the Beast: An All-Star Tribute to Iron Maiden, performing vocals for the Iron Maiden classic "Wasted Years". Snider was joined by his contemporaries and peers George Lynch, formerly of Dokken, and Bob Kulick. Also in 2005, the band released the 2003 Wacken show on CD and DVD simply titled Live at Wacken. It also went on tour with Alice Cooper, acting as the support band but delivering a set similar to a headliner's.
Boston<SEP>One innovation that helped create the powerful sound of the modern piano was the use of a massive, strong, cast iron frame. Also called the "plate", the iron frame sits atop the soundboard, and serves as the primary bulwark against the force of string tension that can exceed 20 tons (180 kilonewtons) in a modern grand piano. The single piece cast iron frame was patented in 1825 in <ENT>Boston<ENT> by Alpheus Babcock, combining the metal hitch pin plate (1821, claimed by Broadwood on behalf of Samuel Hervé) and resisting bars (Thom and Allen, 1820, but also claimed by Broadwood and Érard). Babcock later worked for the Chickering & Mackays firm who patented the first full iron frame for grand pianos in 1843. Composite forged metal frames were preferred by many European makers until the American system was fully adopted by the early 20th century. The increased structural integrity of the iron frame allowed the use of thicker, tenser, and more numerous strings. In 1834, the Webster & Horsfal firm of Birmingham brought out a form of piano wire made from cast steel; it was "so superior to the iron wire that the English firm soon had a monopoly."  But a better steel wire was soon created in 1840 by the Viennese firm of Martin Miller, and a period of innovation and intense competition ensued, with rival brands of piano wire being tested against one another at international competitions, leading ultimately to the modern form of piano wire.
Chernobyl<SEP>The Mystery Park was labeled a " <ENT>Chernobyl<ENT> " by Académie suisse des sciences techniques member Antoine Wasserfallen who was cited by the Swiss newspaper Le Temps and other media. The Swiss federal railroad company (SBB) advertised for the park and sold a combined ticket.
Cluj<SEP>Completed during the 15th century (soon after 1476), the church belongs to the final stages of Gothic architecture. The result was a three-nave basilica, all the same height, as was preferred during the 15th and 16th centuries in the German lands, where most of the architects and masons originated. Many parts of the building show similarities with the church in Sebeș and St. Michael Church of <ENT>Cluj<ENT> , as well as with the Dominikánsky kostol in Košice. The design was itself an inspiration for other religious buildings in the region, and it is possible that a stonemason originally employed on the site later worked on the church in Ghimbav.
Canterbury<SEP>In a survey of British orchestras in 2006, Morrison described the current Philharmonia as "a serious, high-quality orchestra". He praised its "astute and canny" management, and commented that the orchestra had a large, loyal following in London, and had gained additional support elsewhere in Britain by extending its touring programme while the Festival Hall was closed for renovation between 2005 and 2007. Since 2000 the orchestra has established further residencies: at The Anvil, Basingstoke (from 2001), the Marlowe Theatre, <ENT>Canterbury<ENT> and the Three Choirs Festival. Dohnányi's final tour with the orchestra as chief conductor was of the US, where they gave concerts in Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Costa Mesa, California.
Aomori<SEP>Nanbu (南部町, Nanbu-chō) is a town located in <ENT>Aomori<ENT> , Japan. As of 1 March 2017, the town had an estimated population of 18,906, and a population density of 123 persons per km in 7482 households. The total area of the town is 153.12 square kilometres (59.12 sq mi).
Casablanca<SEP>Finally, in December 2011, the university has signed a partnership with the École des Ponts ParisTech and the Académie internationale Mohammed VI de l'aviation civile to launch, in March 2012 at <ENT>Casablanca<ENT> , an Executive MBA in aviation management for aerospace middle management.
Nebraska<SEP>Gregory County lies on the south line of South Dakota. Its south boundary line abuts the north boundary line of <ENT>Nebraska<ENT> . The Missouri River flows southeastward along its east boundary line. The county terrain consists of rolling hills, sloping to the southeast.  The eastern part of the county is etched with gullies and drainages, flowing to the river basin. The county's highest point is in the SW corner, at 2,247' (685m) ASL.
Stockport<SEP>Simon John Yeo (born 10 October 1973 in <ENT>Stockport<ENT> , England) is an English former professional footballer who played as a forward from 1997 to 2011 and is currently striker-coach at Mossley.
Yerevan<SEP>Sadarak (Azerbaijani: Sədərək) is a rayon and the westernmost part of Azerbaijan in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. It was split from the Ilyich rayon (present-day Sharur) in 1990. It has an exclave in Armenia - Karki - which has been under Armenian control since May 1992 when it was captured during the Nagorno-Karabakh War. Sadarak covers 163,74 km, located in the north-west of Nakchivan Autonomous Republic and has three villages. The capital of Sadarak is Heydarabad. The distance from Sadarak to <ENT>Yerevan<ENT> is 60 km.
Basra<SEP>During the second Iraq war in 2003, a Challenger 2 tank became stuck in a ditch while fighting in <ENT>Basra<ENT> against Iraqi forces.  The crew remained safe inside for many hours, the  Burlington LV2 composite armour protecting them from enemy fire, including multiple rocket propelled grenades.
Extremadura<SEP>Having long been the poorest part of Spain, <ENT>Extremadura<ENT> is a largely rural region known for the Portuguese influence on its music. As in the northern regions of Spain, there is a rich repertoire for tabor pipe music. The zambomba friction-drum (similar to Portuguese sarronca or Brazilian cuica) is played by pulling on a rope which is inside the drum. It is found throughout Spain. The jota is common, here played with triangles, castanets, guitars, tambourines, accordions and zambombas.
Boston<SEP>The cost of living in Puerto Rico is high and has increased over the past decade. San Juan's in particular is higher than Atlanta, Dallas, and Seattle but lower than <ENT>Boston<ENT> , Chicago, and New York City. One factor is housing prices which are comparable to Miami and Los Angeles, although property taxes are considerably lower than most places in the United States.
Shusha<SEP>In the 19th century, during an architectural revival that looked back to Armenia's past, the plan of Etchmiadzin Cathedral began to be directly copied in new Armenian churches. Some notable examples from this period include the narthex of the St. Thaddeus Monastery in northern Iran, dating from 1811 or 1819 through 1830, and the Ghazanchetsots Cathedral in <ENT>Shusha<ENT> , dating from 1868. Its plan was also replicated in the Armenian diaspora. One example is the Armenian Church of Bucharest, Romania, designed by Dimitrie Maimarolu and built in 1911-12.
Antofagasta<SEP>The Fairchild F-27 of Aeronor Chile was flying from Santiago to <ENT>Antofagasta<ENT> , with stops in La Serena and Copiapó.
Welwyn<SEP>In 1958, he assumed the directorship of the new Smith, Kline and French Research Institute at <ENT>Welwyn<ENT> . The move ended his responsibility for pharmacology at Leeds, a responsibility he had carried for almost 25 years, much of the time on his own.
Sandvika<SEP>Proposals for the line have been made since the extension to Østerås. The current municipal master plan calls for the line to be extended to Bekkestua Station, where it would again intersect with the Kolsås Line. One possibility is also that the service be continued along the Kolsås Line and a new branch be built to <ENT>Sandvika<ENT> , the municipal center of Bærum. However, an extension has not been a priority for the municipal politicians, although the right-of-way has been secured, which will simplify construction.
Kurukshetra<SEP>Andha Yug is based on the ancient Sanskrit epic, Mahabharata written by Ved Vyasa. The play begins on the eighteenth and last day of the Great Mahabharata War, which devastated the kingdom of Kauravas, the feuding cousins of Pandavas, their capital the once-magnificent Hastinapur lay burning, in ruins, the battlefield of <ENT>Kurukshetra<ENT> was strewn with corpses, and skies filled with vultures and death laments. Fatalities were on both sides as cousins killed each other. The survivors were left grieving and enraged as they continued to blame each other for the destruction. No one was willing to view it as a consequence of their own moral choices.
Parramatta<SEP>Lewisham railway station is on the Inner West & Leppington Line of the Sydney Trains network. This provides access to the city, the interchange station of Strathfield and the commercial centres of Burwood, Newtown and <ENT>Parramatta<ENT> .
Marseille<SEP>Queen Joanna remarried, wedding a cousin, Louis of Taranto, and fled for <ENT>Marseille<ENT> on 11 January 1348. Their other relatives, Robert of Taranto and Charles of Durazzo, visited Louis in Aversa to yield to him. Louis received them amicably and convinced them to persuade their brothers, Philip of Taranto and Louis of Durazzo, to join them. After their arrival, King Louis's "smile was replaced by the harshest expression as he unveiled with terrible words the true feelings he had for the princes and that he had kept hidden until then", according to the contemporaneous Domenico da Gravina. He repeated his former accusations, blamed his kinsmen for his brother's murder, and had them captured on 22 January. The next day Charles of Durazzo –  the husband of Joanna I's sister, Mary – was beheaded upon Louis's orders. The other princes were kept captive and sent to Hungary, together with Louis's infant nephew, Charles Martel.
Breda<SEP>The Producers has been presented professionally in many cities around the world, including Toronto, Berlin, <ENT>Breda<ENT> , Melbourne, Brisbane, Cairns, Sydney, Christchurch, Tel Aviv, Seoul, Buenos Aires, Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Copenhagen, Milan, Budapest, Madrid, Halifax, Mexico City, Prague, Stockholm, Panama, Bratislava, Vienna, Helsinki, Athens, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Caracas, Lisbon, Gothenburg, Oslo, Oradea, Varde, Moscow, Ghent, Manila, and Belgrade.
Pisa<SEP>Saint Macarius the Great, one of the Egyptian desert recluses and a disciple of Saint Anthony the Great, is depicted on the right edge of the Triumph of Death fresco in <ENT>Pisa<ENT> . A group of leisurely aristocrats and their animals occupy the central part of the fresco. These rich young men and women riding horses, surrounded by their decorative hunting dogs have gone on a pleasant journey. Suddenly, their path, somewhere deep in the woods, is barred by three open sarcophagi with bodies in different degrees of decomposition.  Everybody in the scene, including the men, women and even the animals are horrified by this terrible and palpable presence of Death. The unsupportable stench hits their noses. The abhorring scene of cruel Truth dismays them. Only Saint Macarius the Great, made wise and powerful by his faith, stands above them all. The mystic Saint teaches the youngsters a lesson about life and death by reading from the scroll. The Florentine sculptor Benvenuto Cellini was inspired by this depiction of Saint Macarius in his painted portrait.
Pittsburgh<SEP>Merman's next show, Humpty Dumpty, began rehearsals in August 1932 and opened—and immediately closed—in <ENT>Pittsburgh<ENT> the following month. Producer Buddy DeSylva, who also had written the book and lyrics, was certain it could be reworked into a success, and with a revamped script and additional songs by Vincent Youmans, it opened with the new title Take a Chance on November 26 at the 42nd Street Apollo Theatre, where it ran for 243 performances. Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times called it "fast, loud, and funny" and added Merman "has never loosed herself with quite so much abandon." Following the Broadway run, she agreed to join the show on the road, but shortly after the Chicago opening, she claimed the chlorine in the city's water supply was irritating her throat, and returned to Manhattan.
Sarum<SEP>Having lived in London for many years, Seth maintains residences near <ENT>Sarum<ENT> , England, where he is a participant in local literary and cultural events, having bought and renovated the house of the Anglican poet George Herbert in 1996, and in Jaipur, India.
Wuchang<SEP>In 2003 construction began on the second four lane bridge to the west of the existing bridge to meet growing traffic demands. The new bridge was completed in 2006 at a cost of approximately US$40 million. The main span of the new bridge was manufactured in <ENT>Wuchang<ENT> of Wuhan. It was sealed and was towed over 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) upstream to Chongqing. Placement of the piers due to the close proximity to the existing bridge necessitated a longer span; the bridge's main span of 330 metres (1,080 ft) makes it the largest box girder bridge in the world, displacing the previous record holder, the Stolma Bridge. When the bridge was opened southbound traffic was moved onto the new bridge and all four lanes of the original bridge were used for northbound traffic.
Stockport<SEP>In 1957, No. 500 was taken into British Railways stock as No. 48773. It was allocated initially to Polmadie (66A), and was withdrawn from there in 1962.  However, it was reinstated in 1963 and transferred to Carlisle Kingmoor (12A).  It was then transferred to <ENT>Stockport<ENT> (Edgeley, 9B) and Buxton (9L, though perhaps only on paper), and then to Bolton (9K) in September 1964. With the end of steam approaching, No. 48773 was transferred to the North West, moving to Rose Grove (10F) in July 1968. It worked its last main line train on 4 August 1968.
Wakefield<SEP>Katharine Briggs was born in Hampstead, London, the eldest of three surviving daughters of Ernest Edward Briggs, who came from Yorkshire (his family had had great success in coal mining in Halifax and <ENT>Wakefield<ENT> ), and Mary Cooper.  The other two sisters were named Winifred and Elspeth. Ernest was a watercolour artist with a specific interest in Scottish scenery who often told his children stories, possibly sparking Katharine's lifelong interest in them. The family moved to Perthshire in 1911, where Ernest built a house, Dalbeathie House. Ernest died there two years later in 1913.  Katharine began attending Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford in 1918, obtained a BA in 1922, and took her MA in 1926.

York<SEP>Until modern times, the slaughter of animals generally took place in a haphazard and unregulated manner in diverse places. Early maps of London show numerous stockyards in the periphery of the city, where slaughter occurred in the open air. A term for such open-air slaughterhouses was shambles, and there are streets named "The Shambles" in some English and Irish towns (e.g., Worcester, <ENT>York<ENT> , Bandon) which got their name from having been the site on which butchers killed and prepared animals for consumption. Fishamble Street, Dublin was formerly a fish-shambles.

He was found dead in his jail cell on December 21, 2005. According to police, Rodgers committed suicide using a plastic bag.
Selma<SEP>As a young educated man in the period after the Reconstruction era, Logan pushed against the social restraints imposed by white supremacists in the South. For instance, he and a group of friends tried to use their first-class train tickets between Montgomery and <ENT>Selma<ENT> . They were ordered to the Jim Crow car and ejected when they hesitated to move. Logan became the first treasurer of Tuskegee Institute in 1882, and is described as the closest confidante of institute's head, Booker T. Washington.

Porto<SEP>The first event was held on the Boavista street course in <ENT>Porto<ENT> on 17 June 1951 as a sports car race. The Grand Prix was moved to Monsanto Park, Lisbon, in 1954 as a one-off. Monsanto, like the Boavista circuit was a hazardous street circuit lined with trees and had lots of elevation change and fast sweepers; but Monsanto was quite wide as opposed to Boavista, which was narrow. Sportscar events continued until 1957 when the following year it became part of the Formula One world championship. The first Formula One race was held on 14 August 1958 in Boavista. This circuit was situated in a hazardous area; it was laid out through the town and included sections of cobbled street and even tramlines. British drivers Stirling Moss in a Vanwall and Mike Hawthorn in a Ferrari were at the top of the championship table, battling it out for the first eight rain-interrupted laps. Moss then pulled away as Hawthorn slipped behind Frenchman Jean Behra in a BRM until the British car hit spark plug problems. But the drama was only just beginning as a protest was made against Hawthorn who, it was claimed, when he had restarted his car had driven a few yards in the wrong direction, which was against the rules and meant that Hawthorn was to be disqualified. As soon as he heard it, Moss headed to the stewards and told them Hawthorn had been off the course when he was spotted and that was not against the rules. Moss's evidence swung the decision, and no action was taken. Had the protest been upheld, Hawthorn would have lost seven points – six for finishing second and an extra one for recording the fastest lap. In the event, Moss's intervention allowed Hawthorn to win the Drivers' Championship title by one point – from Moss. This race was followed in 1959 by a Grand Prix at Monsanto, which was won again by Moss, this time in a mid-engined Cooper. Australian Jack Brabham hit a telegraph pole after swerving to hit the twice lapped local driver Mario Cabral; Brabham was thrown out of the car and landed on the track; he was then narrowly missed by American Masten Gregory. After this race, Monsanto Park was abandoned, and F1 returned to Boavista in 1960; this race was won by Brabham in a Cooper. The Portuguese Grand Prix was then discontinued and did not return until 1984.

Lahore<SEP>Soon, all the opposition leaders called for the overthrow of Bhutto's regime. Political and civil disorder intensified, which led to more unrest. On 21 April 1977, Bhutto imposed martial law in the major cities of Karachi, <ENT>Lahore<ENT> and Hyderabad. However, a compromise agreement between Bhutto and opposition was ultimately reported. Zia planned the Coup d'état carefully, as he knew Bhutto had integral intelligence in the Pakistan Armed Forces, and many officers, including Chief of Air Staff Air Marshal Zulfiqar Ali Khan and Major-General Tajammul Hussain Malik, GOC of 23rd Mountain Division, Major-General Naseerullah Babar, DG of Directorate-General for the Military Intelligence (DGMI) and Vice-Admiral Syed Mohammad Ahsan, were loyal to Bhutto.

Brescia<SEP>The first printed version, also in German, dates to 1725 and was printed in Cologne by Peter Hammer. A partial copy in Hebrew is found in the Bodleian Library in Oxford, and dates from around 1740. An 18th century manuscript copy exists in French in the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal in Paris, an institution founded in 1757. Another 17th-century manuscript in Italian exists in the 'Legato Martinengo' of the Queriniana Library in <ENT>Brescia<ENT> , Italy. It was part of the collection of the Count and Qabbalist Leopardo Martinengo of Barco and Torre Pallavicina.

Claremont<SEP>Dombrower studied both dance and mathematics at Pomona College in <ENT>Claremont<ENT> .  After his graduation he found it frustrating that the new microcomputer technology had not solved an age-old problem: how choreographers could record their work in written form.  He created the DOM system on an Apple II computer in 1981, which allowed choreographers to use a simple system of codes to enter their work.  The resulting dance movements were then performed by a figure on screen.
Harrogate<SEP>In 1982, Toledano represented Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest in <ENT>Harrogate<ENT> , UK with Hora which was written by Yoram Taharlev. He finished in second place, after the German winner, Nicole.
Hastings<SEP>Tostig Godwinson and Harald Hardrada invaded Northumbria in September 1066 and defeated the local forces under Morcar and Edwin at the Battle of Fulford near York. King Harold received word of their invasion and marched north, defeating the invaders and killing Tostig and Hardrada on 25 September at the Battle of Stamford Bridge. The Norman fleet finally set sail two days later, landing in England at Pevensey Bay on 28 September. William then moved to <ENT>Hastings<ENT> , a few miles to the east, where he built a castle as a base of operations. From there, he ravaged the interior and waited for Harold's return from the north, refusing to venture far from the sea, his line of communication with Normandy.
Derry<SEP>In November 1942 Chelsea was lent to the Royal Canadian Navy and until the end of 1943 operated in the mid and western Atlantic Ocean escorting convoys to and from Great Britain.

Homs<SEP>At the peak of the crisis, some 180,000 people sought temporary accommodation in and around the Syrian capital of Damascus. The Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) and its emergency response affiliate, Focus Humanitarian Assistance (FOCUS) provided immediate humanitarian relief in response to the conflict, establishing a Mother and Child Health Centre at Damascus University campus which provided specialist medical care, a pharmacy and a day care centre for young children. This facility accommodated 1,300 displaced persons; the majority of whom were mothers and young children. In conjunction with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), AKDN and FOCUS established and managed relief distribution warehouses in the key locations of Tartous, <ENT>Homs<ENT> and Salamiyah. The agencies also oversaw registration and profiling of displaced persons, and the distribution of non-food items. Furthermore, over 100 local community volunteers were mobilised to provide essential logistical support to the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP). Volunteers distributed relief items including hygiene kits, plastic sheeting, blankets, mattresses, cooking utensils, safe drinking water and high-energy biscuits to assist families during the conflict and also on their return journey to Lebanon.
Fareham<SEP>Howards' Way is a television drama series produced by BBC Birmingham and transmitted on BBC1 between 1 September 1985 and 25 November 1990. The series deals with the personal and professional lives of the wealthy yachting and business communities in the fictional town of Tarrant on the south coast of England, and was filmed on the River Hamble and the Solent. Most of the location filming for the series was carried out in Bursledon, Hamble, Swanwick, Warsash, Hill Head, Lee-on-the-Solent, Lymington, Southampton and <ENT>Fareham<ENT> —all in Hampshire.
Lahore<SEP>With the Turko-Persian conquests starting in the 11th century, a narrower meaning of Hindustan also took shape. The conqueres were liable to call the lands under their control as "Hindustan" ignoring the rest of the subcontinent. In the early 11th century a satellite state of the Ghaznavids in the Punjab with its capital at <ENT>Lahore<ENT> was called "Hindustan". After the Delhi Sultanate was established, north India, especially the Gangetic plains, came to be called "Hindustan". Scholar Bratindra Nath Mukherjee states that this narrow meaning of Hindustan existed side by side with the wider meaning, and some of the authors used both of them simultaneously.
Aberdeen<SEP>Other cities across Scotland, such as <ENT>Aberdeen<ENT> , Glasgow and Stirling have large organised celebrations too, including fireworks at midnight.
Selma<SEP>Born on April 1, 1947 in <ENT>Selma<ENT> , she was a teacher in the public school system before marrying her husband, who was then in the U.S. Air Force.  After being stationed at the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, the family moved to Tullahoma, Tennessee.  Janice Bowling was a homemaker at first, and became interested in public and community issues, volunteering in many organizations.  In 1992, this led to her being elected to the Tullahoma City Board of Mayor and Aldermen.  Issues of economic development and safety were her initial focus, but she developed a broader range.  In 1994, conservative Republican Van Hilleary, whom Bowling strongly supported, was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, and in 1995, he appointed Bowling to be his District Director.  In that capacity, she dealt with a great deal of constituent and community concerns.  Bowling remained in that position until 2000.
Shusha<SEP>In 1813, under the terms of the Treaty of Gulistan, the region of Karabakh was lost by the Persians to the Russian Empire. Under Russian rule, Karabakh (both Lowland and Highland) was a region with an area of 13,600 km (5,250 sq mi), with <ENT>Shusha<ENT> (Shushi) as its most prominent city. Its population consisted of Armenians and Muslims (mainly of "Tatars" (Azerbaijanis), but also Kurds). The Russians conducted a census in 1823 and had tallied the number of villages (though not the number of people) and assessed the tax basis of the entire Karabakh khanate, which also included Lowland Karabakh. It is probable that the Armenians formed the majority of the population of Eastern Armenia at the turn of the seventeenth century, but following Shah Abbas I's massive relocation of Armenians in 1604-05 their numbers decreased markedly, as they eventually became a minority among their Muslim neighbors.
Yakutsk<SEP>Maria Frolkova was born to a peasant family in Nikolsko in July 1889. Her father was a sergeant in the imperial army who fought in the Russo-Turkish War. She left home at sixteen to marry Afanasy Bochkarev. They moved to Tomsk, Siberia, where they worked as labourers. Her husband abused her, causing her to leave him. She found a job as a servant to employers who coerced her into working in their brothel. They moved her to Sretensk where Maria began a relationship with a local Jewish man named Yakov (or Yankel) Buk. She and Buk opened a butcher shop, but in May 1912 Buk was arrested for larceny and sent to <ENT>Yakutsk<ENT> . Bochkareva followed him into exile, primarily on foot, where the couple established another butcher shop. Buk was caught stealing again and sent to Amga in 1913. Once again Bochkareva followed him. Buk began drinking heavily and became abusive.
Stalingrad<SEP>In 1916, Kint was mobilised to the Russian Army, finished military school at Tsaritsyn (known today as <ENT>Stalingrad<ENT> in Russia) in 1917. During the First World War, he served in an infantry regiment of the Russian Army. In the beginning of 1918, Kint joined a newly formed Estonian regiment at Viljandi. From 1918 to 1920 he fought in the Estonian War of Independence on the broad-tracked armour train No. 2, as Commander of its machine-gun commandos. At the end of the war he was promoted to Lieutenant and acting commander of the train.
Kronstadt<SEP>All four of the Ganguts were assigned to the First Battleship Brigade of the Baltic Fleet in December 1914 – January 1915 when they reached Helsingfors. Their turrets and fire-control systems, however, were still being adjusted and fine-tuned through the next spring. Their role was to defend the mouth of the Gulf of Finland against the Germans, who never tried to enter, so they spent their time training with occasional sorties into the Baltic. Several ships ran aground in 1915 and 1916, often while providing cover for minelaying operations, but only Sevastopol suffered any significant damage. A minor mutiny broke out on 1 November on board Gangut when the executive officer refused to feed the crew the traditional meal of meat and macaroni after coaling. The crews of the battleships joined the general mutiny of the Baltic Fleet on 16 March 1917, after the idle sailors received word of the February Revolution in Saint Petersburg. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk required the Soviets to evacuate their base at Helsinki in March 1918 or have them interned by newly independent Finland even though the Gulf of Finland was still frozen over. Gangut and her sisters led the first group of ships on 12 March and reached <ENT>Kronstadt<ENT> five days later in what became known as the 'Ice Voyage'.

In 1862 her father and her three-year-old sister Isabel died of diphtheria during an epidemic. The family then moved to Birmingham, where some of Alexander Paterson's family lived.
Swindon<SEP>The company had factories and offices not only in Bristol, but also in <ENT>Swindon<ENT> , Dublin, Newcastle and Glasgow. The largest cigarette factory in Europe was opened at Hartcliffe Bristol, and was designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in 1974, but closed in 1990. It proved impossible to find a new use for it and it was demolished in 1999; its site is now the Imperial Park retail complex, but the associated offices became Lakeshore, residential apartments created by Urban Splash.

Nürnberg<SEP>LGB stands for Lehmann Gross Bahn - the "Lehmann Big Train" in German. Made by Ernst Paul Lehmann Patentwerk in <ENT>Nürnberg<ENT> , Germany, since 1968 and by Märklin since 2007, it is the most popular garden railway model in Europe, although there are also many models of U.S. and Canadian prototypes. LGB caused a revival of garden model railroading in the United States when it was introduced. LGB is sold in North America through Wm. K. Walthers, who took over from Ernst Paul Lehmann's subsidiary, LGB of America, when Märklin bought the LGB assets. Most of the European prototypes were manufactured in Germany, while much of the North American rolling stock was made in China. Production is now located in Hungary.
Birmingham<SEP>Galton was born at "The Larches", a large house in the Sparkbrook area of <ENT>Birmingham<ENT> , England, built on the site of "Fair Hill", the former home of Joseph Priestley, which the botanist William Withering had renamed. He was Charles Darwin's half-cousin, sharing the common grandparent Erasmus Darwin. His father was Samuel Tertius Galton, son of Samuel "John" Galton. The Galtons were Quaker gun-manufacturers and bankers, while the Darwins were involved in medicine and science.
Valenciennes<SEP>After the retreat of the French Fifth Army and the BEF, local operations took place from August–October. General Fournier was ordered on 25 August to defend the fortress at Maubeuge, which was surrounded two days later by the German VII Reserve Corps. Maubeuge was defended by fourteen forts, a garrison of 30,000 French territorials and c. 10,000 French, British and Belgian stragglers. The fortress blocked the main Cologne–Paris rail line, leaving only the line from Trier to Liège, Brussels, <ENT>Valenciennes<ENT> and Cambrai open to the Germans, which was needed to carry supplies southward to the armies on the Aisne and transport troops of the 6th Army northwards from Lorraine to Flanders. On 7 September, the garrison surrendered, after super-heavy artillery from the Siege of Namur demolished the forts. The Germans took 32,692 prisoners and captured 450 guns. Small detachments of the Belgian, French and British armies conducted operations in Belgium and northern France, against German cavalry and Jäger.

Barcelona<SEP>After Alaric II's death, Visigothic nobles spirited his heir, the child-king Amalaric, first to Narbonne, which was the last Gothic outpost in Gaul, and further across the Pyrenees into Hispania. The center of Visigothic rule shifted first to <ENT>Barcelona<ENT> , then inland and south to Toledo. From 511 to 526, the Visigoths were ruled by Theoderic the Great of the Ostrogoths as de jure regent for the young Amalaric. Theodoric's death in 526, however, enabled the Visigoths to restore their royal line and re-partition the Visigothic kingdom through Amalaric, who incidentally, was more than just Alaric II's son; he was also the grandson of Theodoric the Great through his daughter Theodegotho. Amalaric reigned independently for five years. Following Amalaric's assassination in 531, another Ostrogothic ruler, Theudis took his place. For the next seventeen years, Theudis held the Visigothic throne.
Bahia<SEP>There is a Portuguese dialect in Helvécia, South of <ENT>Bahia<ENT> that is theorized as presenting signs of an earlier decreolization. Ancient Portuguese creoles originating from Africa are still preserved in the ritual songs of the Afro-Brazilian animist religions (Candomblé).

Potsdam<SEP>After early performances in <ENT>Potsdam<ENT> and Weimar, Haase moved to Prague, where he had considerable success. His career took him to Karlsruhe, Munich, Frankfurt, St. Petersburg and New York, and he became one of the most successful German actors.
Warwick<SEP>He later started up his own bicycle manufacturing business in Plumstead, before moving to Coventry in 1907 to work for the Standard Motor Company. In his later life he was troubled by ill-health, caused by injuries to his legs in his footballing days, and took early retirement. Nevertheless, he was one of the few founding members of Arsenal to live to see the club's rise to success in the 1930s; he reportedly cheered the side's 1936 FA Cup win from his sickbed, while listening to the radio commentary. After many years of ill-health, he died in a hospice in <ENT>Warwick<ENT> in 1948, at the age of 85 and was buried at London Road Cemetery in Coventry.
Sargodha<SEP>Also in India, a small crusady known with the name of Saint Anthony is located in the village called Pothiyanvilai, state of Tamil Nadu Kanyakumari district near Thengapattinam, where thousands of devotees attend every Tuesday and Friday to receive his blessings, miracles, and guidings directly from St. Anthony's soul entering in the body of a holy person for the last 34 years. The southern Indian state of Karnataka is also a holy pilgrimage center in honor of Saint Anthony (specifically located in the small village of Dornahalli, near Mysore). Local lore holds that a farmer there unearthed a statue that was later identified as being that of Saint Anthony. The statue was deemed miraculous and an incident of divine intervention. A church was then erected to honor the saint. Additionally, Saint Anthony is highly venerated in Sri Lanka, and the nation's Saint Anthony National Shrine in Kochikade, Colombo, receives many devotees of Saint Anthony, both Catholic and non-Catholic. There is also a church in Pakistan of Saint Anthony of Padua in the city of <ENT>Sargodha<ENT> under the Diocese of Rawalpindi.

Andorra<SEP>A few of the smaller states survived: the independent principalities of Liechtenstein, <ENT>Andorra<ENT> , Monaco, and the republic of San Marino. (Vatican City is a special case. All of the larger Papal States save the Vatican itself were occupied and absorbed by Italy by 1870. The resulting Roman Question was resolved with the rise of the modern state under the 1929 Lateran treaties between Italy and the Holy See.)
San Remo<SEP>The population density of Liguria is much higher than the national average (300 inhabitants per km, or 770 per sq mi), being only less than Campania's, Lombardy's and Lazio's. In the province of Genoa, it reaches almost 500 inhabitants per km, whereas in the provinces of Imperia and Savona it is less than 200 inhabitants per km. The Spanish traveller Pedro Tafur, noting it from sea in 1436, remarked "To one who does not know it, the whole coast from Savona to Genoa looks like one continuous city, so well inhabited is it, and so thickly studded with houses," and today over 80% of the regional population still lives permanently near to the coast, where all the four major cities above 50,000 are located: Genoa (pop. 610,000), La Spezia (pop. 95,000), Savona (pop. 62,000) and <ENT>San Remo<ENT> (pop. 56,000).
Portsmouth<SEP>While operating off Guadalcanal Island with US Navy Task Force 67 on 5 January 1943, she was attacked by four Japanese aircraft. A bomb blew the top off X turret, killing 13 sailors. Between April 1943 and May 1944 Achilles was docked in <ENT>Portsmouth<ENT> , England for repairs and modernisation. Her single 4-inch AA guns were replaced by the dual-purpose QF 4 inch Mk XVI naval gun in four twin mountings, modern radar was fitted, and the damaged X turret was replaced by four QF 2 pom poms in a quadruple-mount. The work was delayed by a dockyard explosion that killed 14 men. Stoker William Dale was awarded the Albert Medal for Lifesaving for his actions in saving the lives of several dockyard workers.
Tenerife<SEP>Peter of Saint Joseph de Betancur (or Betancourt) y Gonzáles, O.F.B. (Spanish: Pedro de San José de Betancur y Gonzáles, March 21, 1626 ( <ENT>Tenerife<ENT> ) – April 25, 1667 (Antigua Guatemala), called Hermano Pedro de San José Betancurt (Brother Peter of Saint Joseph Betancur) or more simply Peter de Betancurt,  Hermano Pedro (Brother Peter), Santo Hermano Pedro (Saint Brother Peter), or San Pedro de Vilaflor (Saint Peter of Vilaflor), was a Spanish saint and missionary in Guatemala. Known as the "St. Francis of Assisi of the Americas", he is the first saint native to the Canary Islands, is also considered the first saint of Guatemala and Central America for having done his missionary work in those American lands. He was the founder of Order of Our Lady of Bethlehem.
Conn<SEP>Other studies have examined trends in firearm-related deaths before and after gun control laws are either enacted or repealed. A 2004 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found evidence that child access prevention laws were "associated with a modest reduction in suicide rates among youth aged 14 to 17 years." Two 2015 studies found that the permit-to-purchase law passed in <ENT>Conn<ENT> in 1995 was associated with a reduction in firearm suicides and homicides. One of these studies also found that the repeal of Missouri's permit-to-purchase law was associated with "a 16.1% increase in firearm suicide rates," and a 2014 study by the same research team found that the repeal of this law was associated with a 16% increase in homicide rates. A 2000 study designed to assess the effectiveness of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act found that the law was not associated with reductions in overall homicide or suicide rates, but that it was associated with a reduction in the firearm suicide rate among individuals aged 55 or older. A 1991 study looked at Washington, D.C.'s Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975, which banned its residents from owning all guns except certain shotguns and sporting rifles, which were also required to be unloaded, disassembled, or stored with a trigger lock in their owners' homes. The study found that the law's enactment was associated with "a prompt decline in homicides and suicides by firearms in the District of Columbia." A 1996 study reanalyzed this data and reached a significantly different conclusion as to the effectiveness of this law.
Palawan<SEP>A common threat to the tribes for which Survival campaigns is the invasion of their lands for exploration of resources. This invariably leads to forced relocation, loss of sustainability and forced changes in their way of living. Usually, this is accompanied by diseases from the contact with the outsiders for which they have an unprepared immune system – this threat alone can wipe out entire tribes. Logging and/or cattle ranchers have affected most of these tribes, from South America, Africa to Australasia. The Arhuaco, in Colombia, have drug plantations, associated with crossfire from guerilla wars between cartel and government interests. The Ogiek, in Kenya, have tea plantations, and the Amungme in Indonesia, the San in Botswana, the Dongria Kondh in India, and <ENT>Palawan<ENT> in the Philippines have mining fields.
Bataan<SEP>Rev. Fr. Rogelio Alarcon, O.P., former rector and president of Colegio de San Juan de Letran in Intramuros, Manila and an alumnus proposed the idea of having another campus in the north. <ENT>Bataan<ENT> was chosen. Initially, two sites were presented: Hermosa and Balanga City. Abucay came into the picture later, after three years in the conceptualization stage. By what could be described as heavenly intercession and providential twists, Abucay was selected. The community of St. John Lateran, the Board of Colegio de San Juan de Letran and the Council of the Philippine Dominican Province approved the establishment of Letran-Abucay in 1998.
Maisons<SEP>The annual Prix Miesque at the Hippodrome in <ENT>Maisons<ENT> , Yvelines is held in her honor. In America, the Miesque Stakes was run at Hollywood Park Racetrack, where Miesque won her first Breeders' Cup Mile, until that track closed in 2013.
Carcassonne<SEP>Life became generally less secure after the Carolingian period. This resulted in the building of castles at strategic points, many of them being constructed as strongholds of the Normans, descendants of the Vikings who invaded northern France under Rollo in 911. Political struggles also resulted in the fortification of many towns, or the rebuilding and strengthening of walls that remained from the Roman period. One of the most notable surviving fortifications is that of the city of <ENT>Carcassonne<ENT> . The enclosure of towns brought about a lack of living space within the walls, and resulted in a style of town house that was tall and narrow, often surrounding communal courtyards, as at San Gimignano in Tuscany.
Stalingrad<SEP>Mikhaylovka (Russian: Миха́йловка) is a town in Volgograd Oblast, Russia, located on the right bank of the Medveditsa River, 210 kilometers (130 mi) northwest of <ENT>Stalingrad<ENT> . Population: 59,132 (2010 Census); 60,034 (2002 Census); 58,323 (1989 Census).

Kronstadt<SEP>On 9 July, the Russian fleet, under Admiral Peter Khanykov, came out from <ENT>Kronstadt<ENT> . The Swedes massed a fleet under Swedish Admiral Cederstrom, consisting of 11 line-of-battle ships and five frigates at Örö and Jungfrusund to oppose them. On 16 August, Saumarez then sent Centaur and Implacable, under Captain Thomas Byam Martin, also a 74-gun third rate, to join the Swedish fleet. They chased two Russian frigates on 19 July and joined the Swedes the following day.
Casablanca<SEP>Assigned to the 10th Fleet, Ford transited the Panama Canal 4 June and joined a Trinidad-bound convoy the 6th. For the next 6 months she ranged the North and South Atlantic from New York and Charleston, South Carolina, to <ENT>Casablanca<ENT> , French Morocco, and Recife, Brazil, protecting supply convoys from U-boats. After ASW training late in December, she joined Guadalcanal out of Norfolk, Virginia 5 January 1944 for offensive ASW operations in the Atlantic. The destroyer supported the destruction of German submarine U-544 by planes from Guadalcanal, who surprised and depth charged the submarine while refueling west of the Azores 16 January.

Graduating cum laude in 1926, she became supervisor of music for the Goldsboro, North Carolina public school system.  She commuted to New York's Columbia University between 1929 and 1931 and received her Master of Arts in Teaching.
Virginia<SEP>On April 13, 1959, Grissom received official notification that he had been selected as one of the seven Project Mercury astronauts. Grissom and the six other men, after taking a leave of absence from their respective branches of the military service, reported to the Special Task Group at Langley Air Force Base in <ENT>Virginia<ENT> on April 27, 1959, to begin their astronaut training.
Brunswick<SEP>Born in Lewiston, Maine, McFadden graduated Phi Beta Kappa and summa cum laude from Bowdoin College in <ENT>Brunswick<ENT> , in 1978.  Afterward, she received her Juris Doctorate degree from Columbia Law School in New York City in 1984.
Mysore<SEP>The Indian rulers bore various titles – including Chhatrapati (exclusively used by the 3 Bhonsle dynasty of the Marathas) ("emperor"), Maharaja or Raja ("king"), Sultan, Nawab, Emir,  Raje, Nizam, Wadiyar (used only by the Maharajas of <ENT>Mysore<ENT> , meaning "lord"), Agniraj Maharaj for the rulers of Bhaddaiyan Raj, Chogyal, Nawab ("governor"), Nayak, Wāli, Inamdar, Saranjamdar and many others. Whatever the literal meaning and traditional prestige of the ruler's actual title, the British government translated them all as "prince," to avoid the implication that the native rulers could be "kings" with status equal to that of the British monarch.
Puebla<SEP>Jamar's brother DaMarcus Beasley also is a professional soccer player, having played for the Los Angeles Galaxy, Chicago Fire, PSV Eindhoven, Manchester City, Rangers F.C., Hannover 96, <ENT>Puebla<ENT> , and Houston Dynamo as well as the United States national team who he has represented at four World Cups.

Gorton<SEP>Broughton Rangers were founded in 1877. They were one of the twenty-one clubs to meet at the George Hotel, Huddersfield on 29 August 1895 to form the Northern Rugby Football Union. They were originally based in Broughton, Salford. In 1933, they moved out of Salford and into the Manchester district of <ENT>Gorton<ENT> and were renamed Belle Vue Rangers in 1946. The original club folded in 1955. In 2005, local businessman, Stefan Hopewell attempted to resurrect the club and now owns the intellectual property to Broughton Rangers and Belle Vue Rangers.
West Brom<SEP>The Walsall Canal eventually formed a through route between the Birmingham Canal Navigations main line at Pudding Green, and the Wyrley and Essington Canal at Birchills Junction, but it was built in several stages over many years. The first section from Pudding Lane Junction to Ryders Green Junction was part of the Wednesbury Canal, which ran to Hill Top in <ENT>West Brom<ENT> , and opened in 1769. The next part to be opened was authorised by the Act of Parliament for the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal, although it was never connected to their main line. It was built by the Birmingham Canal Navigations, as the two companies merged once the Act had been obtained. It ran from Ryders Green Junction to Broadwaters, a mining complex near Moxley, and opened in 1786. This section includes the site of the Tame Valley Junction.
Motherwell<SEP>The town has rail links to Glasgow, Falkirk, <ENT>Motherwell<ENT> and Edinburgh via Cumbernauld railway station. There is also a station at Greenfaulds. Croy railway station to the north of the town has rail links to Edinburgh, Alloa, Dunblane and Glasgow. A fully electric service to Falkirk Grahamston is proposed using the Cumbernauld Line. Other working lines include the Argyle Line and the North Clyde Line.
Maryhill<SEP>Professor Andrew "Andy" MacMillan OBE RSA FRIAS RIBA (11 December 1928, <ENT>Maryhill<ENT> , Glasgow - 16 August 2014, Inverness) was a Scottish architect, educator, writer and broadcaster. He served as head of the Mackintosh School of Architecture in Glasgow between 1973 and 1994 and was awarded the Royal Society of Arts gold medal (1975) and the inaugural lifetime achievement award of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland. In 1986 he was Davenport Visiting Professor at Yale University.
Central Florida<SEP>Carrollwood was founded in 1959 and was built out in the 1960s. The community spread westward during the 1970s and 1980s. The community was planned by Matt Jetton and originally developed by his land development company, Sun State Homes. From 1959 through 1970, more than 900 homes were built on land in the vicinity of Lake Carroll. Carrollwood Elementary school was constructed in 1963. Carrollwood was struck by a tornado outbreak, which occurred throughout <ENT>Central Florida<ENT> on April 4, 1966. As the neighboring development of Carrollwood Village was established in the early 1970s, the Carrollwood Country Club  was built in 1972 and remains a popular landmark in the community today.
Aberdeen<SEP>Braathens SAFE introduced services from Kristiansund to Stavanger in 1997, due to the increased oil traffic. Also <ENT>Aberdeen<ENT> , Scotland, became an important destination, and there were regular charter flights between the cities, up to five a week. City Star Airlines operated a scheduled route between the two cities from 2005 until the airline folded in 2008.
Mysore<SEP>In 1766, when Tipu Sultan was just 15 years old, he got the chance to apply his military training in battle for the first time, when he accompanied his father on an invasion of Malabar. After the incident- Siege of Tellicherry in Thalassery in North Malabar, Hyder Ali started losing his territories in Malabar. Tipu came from <ENT>Mysore<ENT> to reinstate the authority over Malabar. After the Battle of the Nedumkotta (1789–90), due to the monsoon flood, the stiff resistance of the Travancore forces and news about the attack of British in Srirangapatnam he went back.
Leyte<SEP>The Philippines campaign, the Battle of the Philippines or the Liberation of the Philippines (Filipino: Kampanya sa Pilipinas, Labanan sa Pilipinas & Liberasyon ng Pilipinas), (Operation Musketeer I, II, and III) (Filipino: Operasyon Mosketero I, II, at III), was the American and Filipino campaign to defeat and expel the Imperial Japanese forces occupying the Philippines during World War II. The Japanese Army overran all of the Philippines during the first half of 1942. The liberation of the Philippines commenced with amphibious landings on the eastern Philippine island of <ENT>Leyte<ENT> on October 20, 1944. United States and Philippine Commonwealth military forces were progressing in liberating territory and islands when the Japanese forces in the Philippines were ordered to surrender by Tokyo on August 15, 1945, after the dropping of the atomic bombs on mainland Japan and the Soviet invasion of Manchuria.
Cardiff City<SEP>Coal Hill School appeared again twenty-five years later, in the 50th anniversary special "The Day of the Doctor". The Eleventh Doctor's companion Clara Oswald is shown to have become an English teacher at the school. The school sign names the Headmaster as W Coburn, making reference to Anthony Coburn, who wrote An Unearthly Child, and lists I. Chesterton as the head of governors. Reviewers saw the Coal Hill sequence in "The Day of the Doctor" as a pleasant nostalgic touch or a "delightful Easter Egg", though Ian Sadler of online magazine Hi! felt the school was included "just so fans could be teased with an irrelevant scene." The Coal Hill sequence in "The Day of the Doctor" was filmed at Gladstone Primary School, Whitchurch Road, <ENT>Cardiff City<ENT> .
Wiener Neustadt<SEP>After the failed Siege of Vienna in 1529, Sultan Suleiman gathered another massive army of 120,000 troops to besiege Vienna a second time in 1532. The small garrison of Koszeg consisting of 700 men led by Croatian Captain Nikola Jurišić blocked the way to Vienna for the main Ottoman army. In the meantime, 8,000 Ottoman-Moldavian light cavalry, under Kazim Bey, raided Styria and bypassed <ENT>Wiener Neustadt<ENT> , and southern parts of  Lower Austria. When Kazim Bey was informed of the retreat of the Ottoman main army, he gathered his raiders in Pottenstein to link up with the main army. Of the three possible valleys he could follow, two were blocked by Abatis. An Austrian detachment under Sebastian Schertlin von Burtenbach managed to drive the Turks into the only remaining open valley, where a large army of 20,000 Landsknechts, 1,000 heavy cavalry, 1,000 light cavalry from Hungary and artillery led by Palatinian Count Frederick, Count Bálint Török and Johann Katzianer were waiting for them.
Seattle<SEP>The Massachusetts Turnpike crosses Westfield just north of Westfield Center. The "Mass Pike" is part of Interstate 90 extending east to Boston and west to Albany and across the United States to <ENT>Seattle<ENT> . About 3 miles (5 km) east of Westfield, the turnpike intersects Interstate 91 which generally follows the Connecticut River Valley south to Springfield, Hartford and New Haven or north to Canada (Quebec).
Utah<SEP>Legislatures, being importuned by businesses expecting to profit from operating a PKI, or by the technological avant-garde advocating new solutions to old problems, have enacted statutes and/or regulations in many jurisdictions authorizing, endorsing, encouraging, or permitting digital signatures and providing for (or limiting) their legal effect. The first appears to have been in <ENT>Utah<ENT> in the United States, followed closely by the states Massachusetts and California. Other countries have also passed statutes or issued regulations in this area as well and the UN has had an active model law project for some time. These enactments (or proposed enactments) vary from place to place, have typically embodied expectations at variance (optimistically or pessimistically) with the state of the underlying cryptographic engineering, and have had the net effect of confusing potential users and specifiers, nearly all of whom are not cryptographically knowledgeable. Adoption of technical standards for digital signatures have lagged behind much of the legislation, delaying a more or less unified engineering position on interoperability, algorithm choice, key lengths, and so on what the engineering is attempting to provide.
Lugano<SEP>Paul Svedenborg (born 24 April 1947) is a Norwegian chess player who won the Norwegian Chess Championship twice, in 1966 and 1967, representing the chess club in Narvik.  He represented the Norwegian national team in the Chess Olympiads of 1964 in Tel Aviv, and 1968 in <ENT>Lugano<ENT> .
Weissach<SEP>The Porsche 911 RSR-19 was revealed to have been in development since 2017. In September 2018, spy shots of the new car were seen, published in the German Auto motor und sport automobile magazine, taken at the test track of the Porsche Development Center in <ENT>Weissach<ENT> , with initial rumors saying that the car would be turbocharged. In March 2019, a 30 hour endurance test was held at the Circuit Paul Ricard, in France. In May 2019, ahead of the 2019 24 Hours of Le Mans, one of the prototypes was spotted at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza, being pitted against its predecessor.
Irish Republic<SEP>He was sent to Paris to join Seán T. O'Kelly, as an envoy of the newly <ENT>Irish Republic<ENT> . Gavan Duffy published articles and pamphlets urging recognition of Ireland as a sovereign nation at the Paris Peace Conference, which caused increasing embarrassment to the French establishment, who believed his publications were damaging Anglo-French relations.
West Edmonton<SEP>During the "Crüesing Through Canada Tour '82", there were several widely publicized incidents. First, the band was arrested and then released at Edmonton International Airport for wearing their spiked stage wardrobe (considered "dangerous weapons") through customs, and for Neil arriving with a small carry-on filled with porn magazines (considered "indecent material"); both were staged PR stunts. Customs eventually had the confiscated items destroyed. Second, while playing Scandals Disco in <ENT>West Edmonton<ENT> , a spurious "bomb threat" against the band made the front page of the Edmonton Journal on June 9, 1982; Lee and assistant band manager Greif were interviewed by police as a result. This too ended up being a staged PR stunt perpetrated by Greif. Lastly, Lee threw a television set from an upper story window of the Sheraton Caravan Hotel. Canadian rock magazine Music Express noted that the band was "banned for life" from the city. Despite the tour ending prematurely in financial disaster, it was the basis for the band's first international press. In 1983, the band changed management from Coffman to Doug Thaler and Doc McGhee. McGhee is best known for managing Bon Jovi and later Kiss, starting with their reunion tour in 1996. Greif subsequently sued all parties in a Los Angeles Superior Court action that dragged on for several years, and coincidentally later re-surfaced as manager of Sixx's former band, London. Coffman himself was sued by several investors to whom he had sold "stock in the band", including Michigan-based Bill Larson. Coffman eventually declared bankruptcy, as he had mortgaged his home at least three times to cover band expenses.
Mysore<SEP>The national highway passes through Kannur town.  Goa and Mumbai can be accessed on the northern side and Cochin and Thiruvananthapuram can be accessed on the southern side.  The road to the east of Iritty connects to <ENT>Mysore<ENT> and Bangalore.   The nearest railway station is Kannur on Mangalore-Palakkad line.  Trains are available to almost all parts of India subject to advance booking over the internet.  There are airports at Mattanur, Mangalore and Calicut. All of them are international airports but direct flights are available only to Middle Eastern countries.
Indianapolis<SEP>Daniel Smith opened the first tavern in Tipton, then known as Canton, called the Canton House. A second tavern was opened in 1846 by Andrew J. Redmond, who would eventually become the town  sheriff. John Cassler was the first merchant to locate his business in Tipton. On the east side of the town square, Cassler ran his business out of a log cabin. In 1845, he was granted the license to sell groceries and liquor. Starting in 1850, Newton J. Jackson began selling goods. He eventually became the first auditor for the county. Charles and Conde Bishop were the first carpenters in Tipton. A tanyard was founded by William and Elijah Hall in 1847. The business closed in 1882 due to innovations in tanning. Merchandise was delivered to Tipton via wagons and on horseback from Lafayette, Peru, and <ENT>Indianapolis<ENT> . By 1851, Tipton had blacksmiths, a cabinetmaker, a bakery, a saddlery, and a gunsmith. The Young Furniture Company was founded in 1850.
Karlsruhe<SEP>In March 1945, the First Army fought through the Siegfried Line fortifications in the Bienwald Forest near Lauterbourg. Subsequently, the First Army crossed the Rhine near Speyer and captured <ENT>Karlsruhe<ENT> and Stuttgart. Operations by the First Army in April 1945 encircled and captured the German XVIII. S.S.-Armeekorps in the Black Forest and cleared southwestern Germany.
Kyoto<SEP>Japan's first modern postal service got started in 1871, with mail professionally traveling between <ENT>Kyoto<ENT> and Tokyo as well as the latter city and Osaka. This took place in the midst of the rapid industrialization and social reorganization that the Meiji period symbolized in Japanese history. Given how the nation's railroad technology was in its infancy, Japan's growing postal system relied heavily on human-powered transport, including rickshaws, as well as horse-drawn methods of delivery. For example, while commemorating the 50th anniversary of Japan's postal service, the country's 1921 government released decorative postcards depicting intrepid horseback riders carrying the mail.
Formby<SEP>Brought up in <ENT>Formby<ENT> , he studied drama at St Mary's University, Twickenham, subsequently gaining an MA in Theatre and Film from the University of Sheffield. His early career included work as a football archivist and floor manager for Sky Sports, before leaving to work as an administrator for various theatre companies. From 1996 to 1999 he worked as administrator with the experimental theatre company Complicite, (where he met his wife Madeline) before leaving to become a full-time writer.
Plymouth<SEP>The French intention to bring the bulk of their Mediterranean fleet to join the Dutch fleet at Dunkirk was known to Prince Rupert by 10 May and discussed by Charles and his Privy Council on 13 May. The next day, two privy councillors were delegated to discuss the matter with Albemarle. The delegates recorded that Albemarle would not object to detaching a squadron under Prince Rupert to block the Strait of Dover, provided he were left with at least 70 ships to fight the Dutch. Rupert selected 20 generally fast or well-armed ships from the fleet with instructions to collect any extra ships that might be available at Portsmouth or <ENT>Plymouth<ENT> . Rupert’s original instructions were to attack Beaufort’s fleet whose original 32 ships included several weakly armed, poorly manned or slow vessels. However, once it was known that Duquesne’s squadron was intended to joined Beaufort, he was instructed only to attack if the French fleet was at anchor or was attempting an invasion, but otherwise to rejoin the main fleet as soon as he had encountered Beaufort or had credible information that the French fleet was not close enough to be a danger. In the event the French fleet did not appear.
Shrewsbury<SEP>Carmarthenshire is served by the main line railway service operated by Transport for Wales Rail which links London Paddington, Cardiff Central and Swansea to southwest Wales. The main hub is Carmarthen railway station where some services from the east terminate. The line continues westwards with several branches which serve Pembroke Dock, Milford Haven and Fishguard Harbour (for the ferry to Rosslare Europort and connecting trains to Dublin Connolly). The Heart of Wales Line takes a scenic route through mid-Wales and links Llanelli with Craven Arms, from where passengers can travel on the Welsh Marches Line to <ENT>Shrewsbury<ENT> .
Sargodha<SEP>The Sikhs made tremendous contributions to Punjab from 1857 to 1947. Sikhs founded the city of Rawalpindi. Sikh agricultural and entrepreneurial skills brought prosperity to Sheikhupura, Sialkot, Jhelum, Multan, <ENT>Sargodha<ENT> , Gujrat, Ludhiana, Amritsar, Jullundar. Lahore, the capital of undivided Punjab, had thriving Sikh neighborhoods.
Salamanca<SEP>With Lusitania (and Asturia and Gallaecia), Rome had completed the conquest of the Iberian peninsula, which was then divided by Augustus (25–20 BC or 16-13 BC) into the eastern and northern Hispania Tarraconensis, the southwestern Hispania Baetica and the western Provincia Lusitana. Originally, Lusitania included the territories of Asturia and Gallaecia, but these were later ceded to the jurisdiction of the new Provincia Tarraconensis and the former remained as Provincia Lusitania et Vettones. Its northern border was along the Douro river, while on its eastern side its border passed through Salmantica ( <ENT>Salamanca<ENT> ) and Caesarobriga (Talavera de la Reina) to the Anas (Guadiana) river.
Pisa<SEP>As Baldwin III was often on military campaigns, he realized he had few reliable advisers. From 1154 onwards, Melisende is again associated with her son in many of his official public acts. In 1156, she concluded a treaty with the merchants of <ENT>Pisa<ENT> . In 1157, with Baldwin on campaign in Antioch, Melisende saw an opportunity to take el-Hablis, which controlled the lands of Gilead beyond the Jordan. Also in 1157, on the death of patriarch Fulcher, Melisende, her sister Ioveta the Abbess of Bethany, and Sibylla of Flanders had Amalric of Nesle appointed as patriarch of Jerusalem. Additionally, Melisende was witness to her son Amalric's marriage to Agnes of Courtenay in 1157. In 1160, she gave her assent to a grant made by her son Amalric to the Holy Sepulchre, perhaps on the occasion of the birth of her granddaughter Sibylla to Agnes and Amalric.
Sheffield<SEP>During this time, he was distracted by concerns about style and possible libel in Keep the Aspidistra Flying. He made a quick visit to Liverpool and during March, stayed in south Yorkshire, spending time in <ENT>Sheffield<ENT> and Barnsley. As well as visiting mines, including Grimethorpe, and observing social conditions, he attended meetings of the Communist Party and of Oswald Mosley ("his speech the usual claptrap – The blame for everything was put upon mysterious international gangs of Jews") where he saw the tactics of the Blackshirts ("...one is liable to get both a hammering and a fine for asking a question which Mosley finds it difficult to answer."). He also made visits to his sister at Headingley, during which he visited the Brontë Parsonage at Haworth, where he was "chiefly impressed by a pair of Charlotte Brontë's cloth-topped boots, very small, with square toes and lacing up at the sides."
Covent Garden<SEP>If his intention was to deter pursuit by his non-threatening behaviour, he did not totally succeed. After the authorities promised a large reward, he fled to France for some time but returned a few months later. Shortly afterwards, he is said to have been arrested in the Hole-in-the-Wall tavern in London's Chandos Street, <ENT>Covent Garden<ENT> .  However, there is no record of this in valid historical sources.
Wilmington<SEP>Tropical Depression Two developed from a tropical wave at 1200 UTC on August 19, while located well east of the Lesser Antilles. After tracking west-northwestward for 24 hours, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Bonnie. While at tropical storm intensity, Bonnie passed north of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands on August 21. Early on the following day, a hurricane hunter aircraft indicated that the storm strengthened into a hurricane. Bonnie curved north-northwestward on August 23, shortly before it peaked with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). The storm weakened slightly before making landfall near <ENT>Wilmington<ENT> with winds of 110 mph (175 km/h) early on August 27. The storm briefly weakened to a tropical storm later on August 27, though it re-strengthened into a hurricane as it was re-emerging into the Atlantic. Colder waters weakened Bonnie to a tropical storm by late on August 28. The storm then accelerated east-northeastward offshore New England and Atlantic Canada, before becoming an extratropical cyclone on August 30.
Potsdam<SEP>Haeseler was born in <ENT>Potsdam<ENT> to August Alexis Eduard Haeseler and Albertine von Schönermark. He entered the Prussian army as Lieutenant in 1853 and became aide-de-camp of Prince Frederick Charles of Prussia in 1860. He served in the Danish-Prussian War (1864), the Austro-Prussian War (1866), and the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71). From 1879 he headed the military history department of the general staff, and from 1890-1903 he was General of the Cavalry and head of the XVI Army Corps in Metz. In 1905 he received the rank of a Generalfeldmarschall. From 1903 he was member of the Prussian House of Lords and worked for the development of the vocational school system. Haeseler died in Harnekop.
Oklahoma<SEP>The Land Run of 1891 was a set of horse races to settle land acquired by the federal government through the opening of several small Indian reservations in <ENT>Oklahoma<ENT> . The race involved approximately 20,000 homesteaders, who gathered to stake their claims on 6,097 plots, of 160 acres (0.65 km) each, of former reservation land.
Westminster<SEP>England had suffered extensively during the war. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle recorded how "there was nothing but disturbance and wickedness and robbery". Certainly in many parts of the country, such as the South-West, the Thames Valley and East Anglia, the fighting and raiding had caused serious devastation. The previously centralised royal coinage system was fragmented, with Stephen, the Empress and local lords all minting their own coins. The royal forest law had collapsed in large parts of the country. Some parts of the country, though, were barely touched by the conflict—for example, Stephen's lands in the south-east and the Angevin heartlands around Gloucester and Bristol were largely unaffected, and David I ruled his territories in the north of England effectively. The king's overall income from his estates, however, declined seriously during the conflict, particularly after 1141, and royal control over the minting of new coins remained limited outside of the south-east and East Anglia. With Stephen often based in the south-east, increasingly <ENT>Westminster<ENT> , rather than the older site of Winchester, was used as the center of royal government.
Stone Mountain<SEP>Norman, from <ENT>Stone Mountain<ENT> , near Atlanta, attended and played athletics for Chamblee High School. In his senior year, he was named First Team All-Region 5-AAA and All-DeKalb County Running Back. In that season, he rushed for over 1,000 yards. In his junior year, he was recognized as All-State after rushing for more than 1,500 yards and 28 TDs and leading his team to a 12-2 record and the 5A state semifinals. That year, he had five touchdowns in one playoff game.
Warwick<SEP>From the bottom of the locks, a 3-mile (5-km) level leads to the four Bascote locks. The top two form a 'riser' or staircase. Six more interspersed locks lead to Radford, after which a 5-mile (8-km) level takes the canal through Leamington Spa to <ENT>Warwick<ENT> . Between these two towns, the canal crosses the River Avon and the former Great Western Railway on aqueducts.
Pune<SEP>Mahendra's passion for cinema prompted him to leave for India and join the Film and Television Institute of India, <ENT>Pune<ENT> in 1966. He had to take up cinematography as he could not gain admissions to other disciplines. At the institute he was exposed to world cinema as he got an opportunity to watch films made by François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard, both associated with the French New Wave movement. In 1969, Mahendra graduated from the institute with a gold medal.
Wakefield<SEP>The Pennine region is sparsely populated by English standards.  Larger population centres are in the foothills and lowlands fringing the southern Pennine range, such as Barnsley, Chesterfield, Halifax, Huddersfield,  Macclesfield, Oldham, Rochdale, and Stockport but most of the northern Pennine range is thinly populated. The cities of Bradford, Derby, Leeds, Manchester, Sheffield, Stoke-on-Trent and <ENT>Wakefield<ENT> also fringe the range.
Piraeus<SEP>Diligiannis first formed a cabinet in 1885; but his warlike policy, the aim of which was, by threatening Turkey, to force the Great Powers to make concessions in order to avoid the risk of a European war, ended in failure. For the powers, in order to stop his excessive armaments, eventually blockaded <ENT>Piraeus<ENT> and other ports, and this brought about his downfall. He returned to power in 1890, with a radical programme, but his failure to deal with the financial crisis produced a conflict between him and the king, and his disrespectful attitude resulted in his summary dismissal in 1892. Diligiannis evidently expected the public to side with him; but at the elections he was badly beaten.
Travnik<SEP>Đinđić was born in Bosanski Šamac, PR Bosnia-Herzegovina, FPR Yugoslavia where his father was stationed as an officer of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA). His paternal side hailed from Toplica in southern Serbia. His mother Mila Dušanić, a housewife, raised him and his elder sister Gordana; the family moved according to his father's jobs. Ten years of Zoran's childhood were spent in the town of <ENT>Travnik<ENT> , in central Bosnia. Eventually, the family moved to capital Belgrade, after his mother had gained a post there. Đinđić attended Ninth Belgrade Gymnasium, subsequently enrolling at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Philosophy, graduating in 1974. During his university days he developed an interest in politics. After being convicted by the communist authorities and through Party-controlled media for his role in his attempt to organize an independent political movement of Yugoslav students, Đinđić emigrated to West Germany thanks to the intervention of former German Chancellor Willy Brandt, who persuaded authorities to let Đinđić come to Germany instead of serving his sentence in Yugoslavia. He continued his studies with professor Jürgen Habermas in Frankfurt.
Frome<SEP>He was born on 31 December 1935, educated at Whitchurch Grammar School, Cardiff, the University of Birmingham and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He was a lecturer in English Law at the University of Birmingham before preparing for ordination at Ridley Hall, Cambridge. He was a curate at Ormskirk Parish Church from 1965 to 1968 and then Selection Secretary for the Advisory Council for Church Ministry until 1974. He was Vicar of <ENT>Frome<ENT> and then Rector of Preston before his appointment as Dean of Ely in 1991, a post he held for 12 years.
Mie<SEP>He attended Keio University and graduated with a degree in Commerce. After several years working at Matsushita, Kawasaki won a seat in the House of Representatives, representing <ENT>Mie<ENT> in 1980.
Daytona<SEP>Meek was born and raised in Tallahassee, Florida. She graduated from Lincoln High School. She remained in north Florida for college and graduated from Florida A&M University (then known as Florida A&M College for Negroes) in 1946. At this time, African Americans could not attend graduate school in Florida, so Meek enrolled in the University of Michigan and received her M.S. degree in 1948. After graduation, Meek was hired as a teacher at Bethune-Cookman University in <ENT>Daytona<ENT> , and then at her alma mater, Florida A&M University. Meek moved to Miami in 1961 to serve as special assistant to the vice president of Miami-Dade Community College. The college was desegregated in 1963, largely due to Meek's integral role in the push for its integration. Throughout her years as an educator, Meek was also active in community projects in the Miami area.
Dunfermline<SEP>Comprised five burghs: <ENT>Dunfermline<ENT> and Inverkeithing in Fife; Queensferry in Linlithgowshire; Culross in Perthshire and Stirling in Stirlingshire.
Niagara<SEP>The show, also enjoyed a 1987 West End run at the Savoy Theatre in London, a second U.S. national tour, a production at the Shaw Festival in <ENT>Niagara<ENT> , Ontario, Canada, and numerous regional and professional and amateur theatrical productions worldwide. In 2007–08, a London revival, presented as a chamber piece and directed by Ted Craig, ran at the Warehouse Theatre.
Harrogate<SEP>Until the late 1950s, the village was the site of a major rural railway junction that was situated on the <ENT>Harrogate<ENT> to Northallerton via Ripon railway line (closed 1968). A branch line ran westwards from Melmerby to the small market town of Masham,  which is famous for its brewing. This line stopped carrying passengers in 1930 and closed completely in 1963. Another line (closed 1959) also ran north-eastwards linking Melmerby with the East Coast Main Line at Thirsk.
Utah<SEP>A significant portion of the stockpile of mustard agent in the United States was stored at the Edgewood Area of Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. Approximately 1,621 tons of mustard agent were stored in one-ton containers on the base under heavy guard. A chemical neutralization plant was built on the proving ground and neutralized the last of this stockpile in February 2005. This stockpile had priority because of the potential for quick reduction of risk to the community. The nearest schools were fitted with overpressurization machinery to protect the students and faculty in the event of a catastrophic explosion and fire at the site. These projects, as well as planning, equipment, and training assistance, were provided to the surrounding community as a part of the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program (CSEPP), a joint program of the Army and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Unexploded shells containing mustard agent and other chemical agents are still present in several test ranges in proximity to schools in the Edgewood area, but the smaller amounts of poison gas (four to 14 pounds) present considerably lower risks. These remnants are being detected and excavated systematically for disposal. The U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency oversaw disposal of several other chemical weapons stockpiles located across the United States in compliance with international chemical weapons treaties. These include the complete incineration of the chemical weapons stockpiled in Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, and Oregon. Earlier, this agency had also completed destruction of the chemical weapons stockpile located on Johnston Atoll located south of Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean. The largest mustard agent stockpile, of about 6,196 tons, was stored at the Deseret Chemical Depot in northern <ENT>Utah<ENT> . The incineration of this stockpile began in 2006. In May 2011, the last one-ton tank of mustard agent was incinerated at the Deseret Chemical Depot, and the last mustard agent artillery shells at Deseret were incinerated in January 2012.
Verona<SEP>Bolzano is connected to the motorway network A22-E45 to Trento and <ENT>Verona<ENT> and to Innsbruck (Austria) and Munich (Germany). In Bolzano South there is a transport hub that connects the dual carriageway MeBo with the A22 motorway. The dual carriageway MeBo (Merano - Bolzano) was completed in 1997 to quickly connect the two metropolitan areas of South Tyrol, Merano and Bolzano, and to relieve the surrounding communities in the district of Burggrafenamt and the old former two-lane State street SS38 (Strada statale 38).
Seattle<SEP>Evanston has gained recognition and reputation for efforts related to sustainability, including those by government, citizens, and institutions. In 2015, the city was named the World Wildlife Fund's Earth Hour Capital after competing against cities including <ENT>Seattle<ENT> and Cleveland. In 2016, Evanston was again a finalist in the competition.
Barcelona<SEP>Another clan with influence in Spain is the Scissionisti di Secondigliano led by Raffaele Amato nicknamed Lo Spagnolo (the Spaniard), because before creating his own clan, he controlled the drug trafficking operation from Galicia to Naples for the Di Lauro clan. Amato was arrested as he left a casino in <ENT>Barcelona<ENT> in 2005.
Oswestry<SEP>Knockin is a village and civil parish lying on the B4396 some 8 km south-east of the town of <ENT>Oswestry<ENT> in north-west Shropshire, England.
Birmingham<SEP>Other London-based bands included The Yardbirds (who would number their ranks three key guitarists Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page), The Kinks (with the pioneer  songwriter Ray Davies and rock-guitarist Dave Davies), and Manfred Mann (considered to have one of the most authentic sounding vocalists in the scene in Paul Jones) and the Pretty Things, beside the more jazz-influenced acts like the Graham Bond Organisation, Georgie Fame and Zoot Money. Bands to emerge from other major British cities included The Animals from Newcastle (with the keyboards of Alan Price and vocals of Eric Burdon), The Moody Blues and Spencer Davis Group from <ENT>Birmingham<ENT> (the latter largely a vehicle for the young Steve Winwood), and Them from Belfast (with their vocalist Van Morrison). None of these bands played exclusively rhythm and blues, often relying on a variety of sources, including Brill Building and girl group songs for their hit singles, but it remained at the core of their early albums.
Texas<SEP>By 2012, many of the long-running reality television show franchises in the United States, such as American Idol, Dancing with the Stars and The Bachelor, had begun to see declining ratings. However, reality television as a whole remained durable in the U.S., with hundreds of shows across many channels. In 2012, New York Magazine's Vulture blog published a humorous Venn diagram showing popular themes across American reality shows then running, including shows set in the U.S. states of Alaska, Louisiana and <ENT>Texas<ENT> , shows about cakes, weddings and pawnbrokers, and shows, usually competition-based, whose title includes the word "Wars".
Hershey<SEP>Chocolate World in <ENT>Hershey<ENT> , Disneyland in California, and Walt Disney World in Florida are among many locations that have used variations of the Carveyor concept.
Kronstad<SEP>After taking over the fortress, the Russians started an extensive building program, mostly extra barracks, and extended the dockyard and reinforced the fortification lines. The long period of peace following the transfer of power was shattered by the Crimean War of 1853–56. The French–English–Ottoman alliance decided to engage Russia on two fronts and sent an Anglo-French fleet to the Baltic Sea. For two summers the fleet shelled the towns and fortifications along the Finnish coast. The bombardment of Sveaborg (also known then as Viapori) by the forces of Richard Saunders Dundas and Charles Pénaud on 9–10 August 1855 lasted 47 hours and the fortress was badly damaged, but they were unable to knock out the Russian guns. After the bombardment, the Anglo-French fleet sent no troops ashore and instead set sail for <ENT>Kronstad<ENT> .
Homs<SEP>In the Syrian city of <ENT>Homs<ENT> , Thursday of the Dead is still commemorated in the same way. Many there now prefer to call it "Thursday of Sweetness", since the purchase of sweets by women and their distribution to children and the poor is seen as a double act of "sweetness".
Berkeley<SEP>The countess had her portrait painted in 1759 by Sir Joshua Reynolds. Following her death, she was buried with her first husband in <ENT>Berkeley<ENT> .
Bedford<SEP>Meg owns a number of racehorses under the company name Mystic Meg Limited, which is based in <ENT>Bedford<ENT> . The horses include Astrodonna, Astronangel, and Astronova and other horses with celestial names.
Kent<SEP>A former co branded Long John Silver's and Taco Bell in <ENT>Kent<ENT> before becoming a Taco Bell store
San Diego<SEP>New Orleans had been preparing for Super Bowl XXXVI ever since the city was awarded the game on October 28, 1998 during the NFL's meetings in Kansas City, Missouri, beating out <ENT>San Diego<ENT> as host city. However, the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks led the league to postpone its September 16 games and play them a week after the scheduled conclusion of the regular season. This caused the playoffs and Super Bowl to be delayed by one week. Rescheduling Super Bowl XXXVI from January 27 to February 3 proved extraordinarily difficult. In addition to rescheduling the game itself, all related events and activities had to be accommodated. This marked the first time in NFL history that the Super Bowl was played in February; all subsequent Super Bowls (excluding Super Bowl XXXVII in 2003) after that have been played in February.
Ely<SEP>Powell was born in Sussex. His parents lived abroad for most of his formative years and he attended The Kings School, <ENT>Ely<ENT> . On leaving school he took several jobs including bus conductor, waiter, window dresser and clerk at the London Stock Exchange and he studied at the London School of Film Technique. He also met Storm Thorgerson and members of the nascent Pink Floyd in Cambridge and struck up lifelong friendships and working relationships.
Cambridge<SEP>The sweating sickness epidemic in 1517 was particularly devastating to Oxford and <ENT>Cambridge<ENT> where it killed half of both cities' populations, including many students and dons.
Winchester<SEP>The Anglo-Saxon monarchs used various locations for their coronations, including Bath, Kingston upon Thames, London, and <ENT>Winchester<ENT> . The last Anglo-Saxon monarch, Harold II, was crowned at Westminster Abbey in 1066; the location was preserved for all future coronations. When London was under the control of rebels, Henry III was crowned at Gloucester in 1216; he later chose to have a second coronation at Westminster in 1220. Two hundred years later, Henry VI also had two coronations; as king of England in London in 1429, and as king of France in Paris in 1431.
West Brom<SEP>The Oak House is a timber framed building dating from the sixteenth century located in Greets Green, <ENT>West Brom<ENT> , England.

Kassel<SEP>In 2004 she participated in Manifesta 5, The European Biennial of Contemporary Art. She has also participated in the 2008 Shanghai Biennale and the 2010 Gwangju and Taipei biennials.  In 2007, her film Lovely Andrea was exhibited as a part of documenta 12 in <ENT>Kassel<ENT> , Germany. In 2013 her work was included in the Venice Biennale and the Istanbul Biennial. In 2015, her work was included in the German pavilion at the Venice Biennale.
Rennes<SEP>René Descartes was born in La Haye en Touraine (now Descartes, Indre-et-Loire), France, on 31 March 1596. His mother, Jeanne Brochard, died soon after giving birth to him, and so he was not expected to survive. Descartes' father, Joachim, was a member of the Parlement of Brittany at <ENT>Rennes<ENT> . René lived with his grandmother and with his great-uncle. Although the Descartes family was Roman Catholic, the Poitou region was controlled by the Protestant Huguenots. In 1607, late because of his fragile health, he entered the Jesuit Collège Royal Henry-Le-Grand at La Flèche, where he was introduced to mathematics and physics, including Galileo's work. After graduation in 1614, he studied for two years (1615–16) at the University of Poitiers, earning a Baccalauréat and Licence in canon and civil law in 1616, in accordance with his father's wishes that he should become a lawyer. From there he moved to Paris.
Dachau<SEP>Ceija Stojka, a Roma girl, sees her father arrested and dragged off to <ENT>Dachau<ENT> , where he later dies. Shortly after, she is rounded up with the rest of her family and shipped to Auschwitz.
Leh<SEP>Magnet Hill is a "Cyclops hill" located near <ENT>Leh<ENT> in Ladakh, India. The layout of the area and surrounding slopes create the appearance of a hill. The hill road is actually a downhill road. Objects and cars on the hill road may appear to roll uphill in defiance of gravity when they are, in fact, rolling downhill.
Lahore<SEP>Nanda was born on 4 July 1898 in Sialkot in the Punjab Province of British India into a Punjabi Hindu family. (After the partition of British India into India and Pakistan in 1947, Sialkot became a part of the Punjab Province of Pakistan.) Nanda received his education in <ENT>Lahore<ENT> , Amritsar, Agra, and Allahabad.
Hilo<SEP>Penn returned to Nova União under coach Andre Pederneiras (who promoted Penn to black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu in 1999) in preparation for his fight camp against Edgar; training alongside former UFC Bantamweight Champion Renan Barão and UFC Featherweight Champion José Aldo. Later in the camp, he also enlisted former UFC Bantamweight Champion Dominick Cruz in <ENT>Hilo<ENT> for his preparation. Penn lost the one sided bout by TKO in the third round.  At the conclusion of the bout, Penn announced his intentions to retire again during the event's post-fight press conference.
Barcelona<SEP>Many Caucasian languages and some Uralic languages (like Komi) also use phonemic schwa, and allow schwas to be stressed. In the Eastern dialects of Catalan, including the standard variety, based in the dialect spoken in and around <ENT>Barcelona<ENT> , an unstressed ⟨a⟩ or ⟨e⟩ is pronounced as a schwa (called "vocal neutra", 'neutral vowel'). A stressed schwa can occur in the Catalan dialects spoken in the Balearic Islands, as well as in Romanian, as in mătură [ˈməturə] ('broom').
Boston<SEP>It has regional centres in Africa [(Nairobi, Kenya)], Asia-Pacific (Singapore), Latin America (São Paulo, Brazil) and North America ( <ENT>Boston<ENT> , United States).
Piraeus<SEP>From June 1946 until November 1947, American Victory was chartered by American Export Lines, carrying foodstuffs and machinery exported from the United States to Europe, Russia and the Near East under the Marshall Plan, the Post-War reconstruction of the European Continent.  Some of her Ports of call were:  Trieste in Italy, Constanza in Romania, <ENT>Piraeus<ENT> in Greece, and Antwerp in Belgium. Departing Odessa, Ukraine to Boston in January of the 1947,  the Black Sea had already iced up, not waiting for the Soviet icebreaker Turgenev to clear the ice, Captain, A. D. Cushman, knowing the SS American Victory was a well built ship, decided to use her as an icebreaker, backing up and ramming the ice so both her and other ships could part the Black Sea. She was then laid up in the Hudson River Reserve Fleet until she was again chartered by commercial shipping lines, U.S. Navigation Company, during the Korean War from 1951 until January 1954, when she entered the Sabine River Reserve Fleet in Texas.
Brechin<SEP>One Glasgow professor left to the Royal College of Music, but one was soon sent back in the form of Robin Orr, Professor of Theory and Composition at the college, appointed to the chair in 1956. He was from <ENT>Brechin<ENT> , Angus, although was in fact adopted and originally of Swiss nationality. He was a noted composer, writing three operas and three symphonies alongside other works. He had previously been organist of St John's College, Cambridge, and it was to Cambridge that he returned in 1964 as the Professor of Music. He was chair of Scottish Opera from 1962 to 1976 and director of Welsh National Opera from 1971 to 1983, and was awarded a CBE in 1972.
Kyoto<SEP>The city of <ENT>Kyoto<ENT> was developed as a planned city in 794 as a new imperial capital (then called Heian-kyō), built on a grid layout modeled after the Tang dynasty capital of Chang'an (modern day Xi'an), and remained the capital for over a millennium. The grid layout remains, reflected in major east-west streets being numbered, such as 4th street (四条, shi-jō). In modern times, Sapporo was built from 1868, following an American grid plan, and is today the fifth-largest city in Japan. Both these cities have regular addressing systems (following the grid) unlike the usual subdivision-based Japanese addressing system.
Busan<SEP>Uiryeong has a convenient location as it sits between Jinju to the west and Haman/Masan/Changwon to the East. A bus runs regularly from the bus terminal in Uiryeong-Eup to all major cities in South Korea. A bus journey to Masan or Jinju takes approximately 35 minutes and 45 minutes respectively from Uiryeong bus terminal, while the journey to <ENT>Busan<ENT> takes 1 hour. It is also possible to take a bus directly to Seoul from Uiryeong.
South Bank<SEP>Charles Ramirez made his professional debut on London’s <ENT>South Bank<ENT> while still a student and has since given many concerts and master classes both in Britain and abroad. He has broadcast regularly for Radio 3, his first programme being chosen for 'Pick of the Week'. He has a special interest in modern contemporary music and has given world premiers of several contemporary works, including 'Nick's Lament' by Erika Fox, 'Sonetos y Casidas del Amor Oscuro' by Jeremy Dale-Roberts (both commissioned with funds from the Arts Council of Great Britain), 'Shades V' by Naresh Sohal, 'Toccata" by John Lambert and 'Serenata for Guitar' by Jesus Eduardo Alvarez, which was dedicated to him.
Tampico<SEP>In mid-May 1846, war broke out between the United States and Mexico. Truxtun was recommissioned at Norfolk on 8 June under the command of Lt. Edward W. Carpender. On the 15th, she passed El Morro castle and anchored in Havana harbor, Cuba. For the next six weeks, the brig operated off the coast of Cuba. On 2 August, the warship cleared Havana and, on the 9th, joined the blockading American fleet just off the Mexican coast at Sacrificios Island. On the 12th, Lt. Carpender received orders instructing him to relieve sloop of war John Adams on station off <ENT>Tampico<ENT> . Early in the evening on 14 August, the brig was heading north in a gale about 100 miles from her destination. She turned in towards land in order to be able to provision ashore the following morning. That maneuver brought her dangerously close to Tuxpan Reef, and she soon ran hard aground. The gale continued to blow and drove her harder upon the reef. Still, her officers and crew tried to free her and declined a Mexican offer to surrender. On the morning of the 15th, she dispatched one of her cutters to the anchorage at Anton Lizardo to seek help.
Pune<SEP>Inspired by her experience with Ray, she decided to join the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), <ENT>Pune<ENT> to learn acting and passed with the gold medal. She was also picked out to play the eponymous role of Guddi in the 1971 Hrishikesh Mukherjee film, Guddi in which she played a school girl obsessed with film star Dharmendra. Guddi was a success, and she moved to Mumbai and soon picked other roles, however her role of a 14-year-old schoolgirl, aided by her petite looks, created the girl-next-door image for her, which she was often associated with through the rest of her career. Though she tried to break out of the mould with glamorous roles as in Jawani Diwani, (1972) and a negative character of the heroine faking amnesia, in Anamika (1973), she was mostly recognised for roles of the sort which were credited with epitomising middle-class sensibility, which she played amiably in films of "middle-cinema" directors such as Gulzar, Basu Chatterjee and indeed Hrishikesh Mukherjee. These films include Uphaar (1971), Piya Ka Ghar (1972), Parichay (1972), Koshish (1972)  and Bawarchi (1972), performed with marked sensitivity. By now, she was a popular star.
Padua<SEP>Konopiště has been open to the public since 1971. Visitors can observe the residential rooms of Franz Ferdinand, who was also an enthusiastic hunter, a large collection of antlers, the "Obizzi-Este collection" (the third largest European collection of armoury and medieval weapons from Castello del Catajo, <ENT>Padua<ENT> , Italy), a shooting hall with moving targets, and a garden with Italian Renaissance statues and greenhouses.
West Edmonton<SEP>Herbert Marshall McLuhan CC (/məˈkluːən/; July 21, 1911 – December 31, 1980) was a Canadian philosopher. His work is one of the cornerstones of the study of media theory. Born in <ENT>West Edmonton<ENT> , Alberta, McLuhan studied at the University of Manitoba and the University of Cambridge. He began his teaching career as a professor of English at several universities in the U.S. and Canada before moving to the University of Toronto in 1946, where he remained for the rest of his life.
Indy<SEP>Marion County is a county in the U.S. state of Indiana. Census 2010 recorded a population of 903,393, making it the largest county in the state and 55th most populated county in the country, greater than the population of six states. The county seat is <ENT>Indy<ENT> , the state capital and largest city. Marion County is consolidated with Indianapolis through an arrangement known as Unigov.
Darfur<SEP>Through the Associazione Umanitaria Padana, Lega Nord participates in humanitarian projects which are intended to respect local cultures, traditions and identities. The campaigns are carried out in poor countries or in those that have suffered from war or natural catastrophes. Locations of missions include <ENT>Darfur<ENT> , Iraq, Afghanistan and Ivory Coast. The association is led by Sara Fumagalli, wife of Roberto Castelli and born-again Catholic after a pilgrimage in Medjugorje.
Malmesbury<SEP>Before the start of the Second World War, the Government decided to disperse certain production to locations away from obvious bombing targets. This led to a shadow factory at Cowbridge House, <ENT>Malmesbury<ENT> , Wiltshire, being established by Ekco. This was followed by other shadow factories at Aylesbury, Woking, Preston, and Rutherglen. The wartime headquarters of Ekco was based at Aston Clinton House in Buckinghamshire. Following the outbreak of war, the Southend-on-Sea factory was evacuated apart from the bakelite moulding shop whose large moulding presses could not be moved easily. Less than a year later, the empty factory was re-equipped to make wiring looms for aircraft such as the Avro Lancaster.

Milan<SEP>Aida met with great acclaim when it finally opened in Cairo on 24 December 1871. The costumes and accessories for the premiere were designed by Auguste Mariette, who also oversaw the design and construction of the sets, which were made in Paris by the Opéra's scene painters Auguste-Alfred Rubé and Philippe Chaperon (acts 1 and 4) and Édouard Desplechin and Jean-Baptiste Lavastre (acts 2 and 3), and shipped to Cairo. Although Verdi did not attend the premiere in Cairo, he was most dissatisfied with the fact that the audience consisted of invited dignitaries, politicians and critics, but no members of the general public. He therefore considered the Italian (and European) premiere, held at La Scala, <ENT>Milan<ENT> on 8 February 1872, and a performance in which he was heavily involved at every stage, to be its real premiere.

Neapolitan<SEP>During its history, the club has acquired a number of nicknames, la Vecchia Signora (the Old Lady) being the best example. The "old" part of the nickname is a pun on Juventus which means "youth" in Latin. It was derived from the age of the Juventus star players towards the middle of the 1930s. The "lady" part of the nickname is how fans of the club affectionately referred to it before the 1930s. The club is also nicknamed la Fidanzata d'Italia (the Girlfriend of Italy), because over the years it has received a high level of support from Southern Italian immigrant workers (particularly from <ENT>Neapolitan<ENT> and Palermo), who arrived in Turin to work for FIAT since the 1930s. Other nicknames include; [La] Madama (Piedmontese for: Madam), i bianconeri (the black-and-whites), le zebre (the zebras) in reference to Juventus' colours. I gobbi (the hunchbacks) is the nickname that is used to define Juventus supporters, but is also used sometimes for team's players. The most widely accepted origin of gobbi dates to the fifties, when the bianconeri wore a large jersey. When players ran on the field, the jersey, which had a laced opening at the chest, generated a bulge over the back (a sort of parachute effect), making the players look hunchbacked.
Kronstad<SEP>The Russian fleet had spent the winter of 1788–1789 in split into several elements at Copenhagen, Reval and <ENT>Kronstad<ENT> .

Boston<SEP>In the hope of securing international recognition, Seán T. O'Kelly was sent as envoy to Paris to present the Irish case to the Peace Conference convened by the great powers at the end of World War I. When it became clear by May 1919 that this mission could not succeed, de Valera decided to visit the United States. The mission had three objectives: to ask for official recognition of the Irish Republic, to float a loan to finance the work of the Government (and by extension, the Irish Republican Army), and to secure the support of the American people for the republic. His visit lasted from June 1919 to December 1920 and had mixed success, including a visit to Fenway Park in <ENT>Boston<ENT> in front of 50,000 supporters. One negative outcome was the splitting of the Irish-American organisations into pro- and anti-de Valera factions. He met the young Harvard-educated leader from Puerto Rico, Pedro Albizu Campos, and forged a lasting and useful alliance with him.

They used the boats to hunt on inland lakes, rivers and coastal waters of the Arctic Ocean, North Atlantic, Bering Sea and North Pacific oceans. These first kayaks were constructed from stitched seal or other animal skins stretched over a wood or whalebone-skeleton frame. (Western Alaskan Natives used wood whereas the eastern Inuit used whalebone due to the treeless landscape). Kayaks are believed to be at least 4,000 years old. The oldest existing kayaks are exhibited in the North America department of the State Museum of Ethnology in <ENT>Munich<ENT> , with the oldest dating from 1577.
Missouri<SEP>Bakili Muluzi, leader of the United Democratic Front (UDF), was elected President in those elections.

The Little Minnesota River flows along the county's SW boundary. Since 1937 a dam (Big Stone Lake Dam) has impounded the river's waters, creating Big Stone Lake. Water flowing out from this lake flows along the south boundary line of the county, and is known as the Minnesota River from that point. Fish Creek flows southwesterly through the NW part of the county, discharging into Big Stone Lake at the county's SW boundary.
Ashkelon<SEP>Rav Judah reported in Samuel's name an account of the rarity of completely Red Cows: When they asked Rabbi Eliezer how far the honor due parents extended, Rabbi Eliezer told of a non-Jew from <ENT>Ashkelon<ENT> named Dama son of Nethinah. The Sages offered Dama a profit of 600,000 gold denarii (or Rav Kahana said 800,000 denarii) in exchange for jewels that he had that the Sages could use in the ephod, but as the key to the jewels lay under Dama's father's pillow, Dama declined the offer so as not to trouble his father. The next year, God rewarded Dama by causing a Red Cow to be born in his herd. When the Sages went to buy it, Dama told them that he knew that he could ask for all the money in the world and they would pay it, but he asked for only the money that he had lost in honoring his father.

White stripes radiating from the diamond represent Vincennes' part in the settlement of the frontier, as it was at the crossroads of several great pioneer trails.
Indian Wells<SEP>Pocklington invested in several businesses in the U.S., including the nutraceutical maker Naturade, and golf club manufacturers Golf Gear and Sonartec. However, those investments yielded more heartache than profit, and what he claims was fiduciary malfeasance by some partners in these ventures left Pocklington the target of numerous lawsuits. In the summer of 2008, one of those suits resulted in raids by U.S. Marshals of the Pocklington home in <ENT>Indian Wells<ENT> , where a number of items belonging to his wife, including gowns, shoes and purses, as well as Andy Warhol prints of Mick Jagger, were seized.

Boston<SEP>Riots defined by "race" have taken place between ethnic groups in the United States since at least the 18th century and they may have also occurred before it. During the early-to-mid- 19th centuries, violent rioting occurred between Protestant "Nativists" and recently arrived Irish Catholic immigrants. These riots reached their heights during the peak of immigration in the 1840s and 1850s in cities such as New York, Philadelphia, and <ENT>Boston<ENT> . During the early 20th century, riots were common against Irish and French-Canadian immigrants in Providence, Rhode Island.
Kronstadt<SEP>Although Golos Truda sharply criticized the anarchist communists of Petrograd as romantics, ignorant of the complex social forces of the Revolution among Petrograd's Bolshevik-supporting factory workers, the ideas of the union and its paper were considered bizarre and met with little initial success. Despite this, the anarchist-syndicalist union persisted and gradually acquired a degree of influence, focusing its efforts through propaganda in Golos Truda, with the intent of capturing the attention of the public with its ideals and by differentiating itself from the other radical factions. The paper's circulation continuing to increase in the city and its provinces, with robust anarchist collectives and meetings emerging in <ENT>Kronstadt<ENT> , Oboukhovo, and Kolpino. In March 1918, the Bolsheviks moved the seat of government from Petrograd to Moscow, and the anarchists swiftly followed, moving the printing of Golos Truda to the new capital.
Clitheroe<SEP>Method of construction and the design of the road surface varied. Before construction of its road, the Bury, Blackburn and Whalley Trust engaged "skilled persons" as temporary surveyors, to make a survey of the districts through which the road would pass.  It then advertised for tenders for construction of varied parts of the roads, with contractors responsible for building their respective portions, under the supervision of permanent surveyors.  The trust bought limestone for the road surface largely from limestone quarries in <ENT>Clitheroe<ENT> .  In Manchester, Liverpool, and Wigan, due to heavy coal traffic it was necessary to lay pavements of large stones along the roads.  Suitable material would, if not found in the vicinity, be imported from the coasts of Wales and Scotland.  Normally the pavement ran down the middle of the road, with a gravelled way on either side.  An exception was along Bury New Road (built in 1826), where the middle track was 4 yards (3.7 m) of gravel, with stone pavements 3 yards (2.7 m) outside it.  Such pavements were expensive, and unpopular with travellers who regularly described their discomfort travelling upon them.
