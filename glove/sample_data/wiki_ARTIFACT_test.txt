Everglades<SEP>Two thirds of the large area in what local residents call "mainland Monroe" is uninhabited by virtue of being part of <ENT>Everglades<ENT> , and the remainder by the Big Cypress National Preserve in the northeastern interior. The area, officially named Cape Sable Census County Division, is virtually uninhabited. As of the Census of 2000, this area had 86.9 percent of the county's land area (2243.58 out of 2,582.00 km (997 sq mi)), but only 0.075 percent of its population (60 out of 79,589). The Census Bureau defines this area as Census Tract 9701 of Monroe County, Florida. With a population density of only 0.0267/km² (0.0693/sq mi), if it were a separate county or county-equivalent, only the Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area of central Alaska would have a lower population density out of all U.S. counties.
Ramsgate<SEP>Green campaigned for a new code of practice in the British Standards framework for the design of ship-to-shore walkways.  This followed the September 1994 Prins Filip ferry disaster in which a walkway linking the ferry to <ENT>Ramsgate<ENT> had collapsed during passenger embarkation killing six people and seriously injuring seven others.  A weld failure was the immediate cause of the collapse but investigations showed errors were made during design, construction, maintenance and inspection of the linkspan structure.  Green lobbied the newly elected Labour government in summer 1997, requesting a meeting on the matter with deputy prime minister John Prescott.  He eventually received an offer to meet with health and safety minister Angela Eagle in 1998 though this was postponed at least once.  Despite the support of an April 1999 Construction Industry Research and Information Association report no progress had been made by 2000.  Green was supported in his campaign by fellow former ICE President Roger Norman Sainsbury.
Rock Island<SEP>Thomas S. James Jr. is a United States Army Lieutenant General who currently serves as Commanding General of First United States Army headquartered at <ENT>Rock Island<ENT> , Illinois; he assumed his present position on October 29, 2018 after having served as Deputy Chief of Staff for United Nations Command/Combined Forces Command/United States Forces Korea.
Falls Church<SEP>Fairfax Parish was the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Anglican church in colonial Virginia with jurisdiction over part of Fairfax County with its central church located <ENT>Falls Church<ENT> .  The parish was created in 1764 from Truro Parish.
South Bank<SEP>The hall was built as part of the Festival of Britain for London County Council, and was officially opened on 3 May 1951. When the LCC's successor, the Greater London Council, was abolished in 1986, the Festival Hall was taken over by the Arts Council, and managed together with the Queen Elizabeth Hall and Purcell Room (opened 1967) and the Hayward Gallery (1968), eventually becoming an independent arts organisation, now known as <ENT>South Bank<ENT> , in April 1998.

Drayton<SEP>In late 2010, Vekoma announced that they would be manufacturing a Family Boomerang. The prototype opened in <ENT>Drayton<ENT> as Ben 10 - Ultimate Mission in April 2011 later renamed to the Accelerator. Another, named Velociraptor, opened on 17 May 2016 in the Lost Kingdom area of Paultons Park. Unlike the other Boomerang roller coasters a Family Boomerang does not feature any inversions but it still has a similar shuttle design. The ride has two end spikes and generally a figure-8 design in the layout.
Southwark<SEP>In October 2013, when Bishop Doyé Agama was elevated to the status of archbishop, J Delano Ellis provided a "Consecration Mandate" and he sent an episcopal delegation (comprising Bishop Darryl Woodson and Bishop Benjamin Douglass) to London, England where they took the principal part in the ceremony of consecration/elevation, at <ENT>Southwark<ENT> .  Archbishop Agama is a member of the Joint College of African-American Pentecostal Bishops and of the House of Bishops of Pentecostal Churches of Christ. He is presiding prelate of Apostolic Pastoral Congress.
Kirtland<SEP>Young participated in many significant events in early Latter Day Saint history. He was present at the dedication of <ENT>Kirtland<ENT> in 1836. Young was also present at Haun's Mill, Missouri, when it was attacked by those who opposed the Mormon presence in Missouri. He left Missouri with the Latter Day Saints in consequence of the extermination order which had been issued by Lilburn W. Boggs.
Dachau<SEP>Schenck was born in Marburg, Hesse-Nassau. He trained as a doctor and joined the SS. During the war, Schenck was actively involved in the creation of a large herbal plantation in <ENT>Dachau<ENT> , which contained over 200,000 medicinal plants, from which, among other things, vitamin supplements for the Waffen-SS were manufactured. In 1940 he was appointed as inspector of nutrition for the SS. In 1943 Schenck developed a protein sausage, which was meant for the SS frontline troops. Prior to its adoption it was tested on 370 prisoners in Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp, some of whom died of hunger edema. In his own memoirs, Schenck stated that his only concern was to improve nutrition and fight hunger. However, a report in 1963 condemned Schenck for "treating humans like objects, guinea pigs". In the Federal Republic of Germany, Schenck was later not allowed to continue his medical career. He was also associated with Erwin Liek's attempts to develop holistic methods to prevent cancer.
Brookwood<SEP>He is buried in the Solomon Family Plot in <ENT>Brookwood<ENT> .
Williamsburg<SEP>PSCU partnered with <ENT>Williamsburg<ENT> on electronic educational programs for schools in the United States.
Southwark<SEP>Lazarus' body is taken in an ambulance. Martha's mother Francine becomes doubtful about Martha's connection with the Doctor after being informed by Harold Saxon that the Doctor is dangerous. The Doctor hears the ambulance crash and finds that the drivers have been drained of life. The Doctor, Martha and Tish chase Lazarus to the <ENT>Southwark<ENT> , where Lazarus sought sanctuary during the Blitz. Martha and Tish lure Lazarus to the top of the Cathedral's bell tower, and the Doctor manipulates the church's pipe organ to produce the maximum volume it can. The vibrations caused by the organ interfere with Lazarus' manipulated DNA and he falls to his death.
Chiswick<SEP>Five houses have been built in England based on Palladio's Villa Rotonda: Henbury Hall, Cheshire, is the most recent; <ENT>Chiswick<ENT> , Greater London, and Mereworth Castle, Kent, are protected as listed buildings; Foots Cray Place, Kent, and Nuthall Temple, Nottinghamshire have been repairt.
Rugby<SEP>Mary Augusta Arnold was born in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, into a prominent intellectual family of writers and educationalists.

The words sung during the title sequences are in Latin:
South Bank<SEP>From 1983 until 1992 Honeyman worked with Echo City, the sonic playground builders and performers, building the UK's first sonic playground in an adventure playground in Bethnal Green, making instruments, playing as a band and running music projects worldwide with children and adults with special needs, working in such varied locations as the Singapore Arts Festival, Glasgow Garden Festival, festivals in Canada and <ENT>South Bank<ENT> in London.
Uppsala<SEP>The earliest fossilised evidence of bone marrow was discovered in 2014 in Eusthenopteron, a lobe-finned fish which lived during the Devonian period approximately 370 million years ago. Scientists from <ENT>Uppsala<ENT> and the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility used X-ray synchrotron microtomography to study the fossilised interior of the skeleton's humerus, finding organised tubular structures akin to modern vertebrate bone marrow. Eusthenopteron is closely related to the early tetrapods, which ultimately evolved into the land-dwelling mammals and lizards of the present day.
Southampton<SEP>Rodwell graduated in Botany from the University of Leeds in 1968, then researched limestone vegetation at <ENT>Southampton<ENT> under Joyce Lambert for his PhD in Biology, awarded in 1974.

Incheon<SEP>Construction of South Korea's largest airport, <ENT>Incheon<ENT> , was completed in 2001, in time for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. By 2007, the airport was serving 30 million passengers a year. The airport has been selected as the "Best Airport Worldwide" for four consecutive years since 2005 by Airports Council International.
Salisbury<SEP>Julian Maynard Smith (son of the evolutionary geneticist John Maynard Smith) and Miranda Payne founded the company in 1980, and Maynard Smith remains its artistic director. Maynard studied fine and performing arts in the 1970s and works as an actor, writer, performer and director. The company has worked with artists and others from many different fields. The work varies enormously in scale, appearance and location and uses spectacle to explore the intimate relationship between people and the environment they inhabit. Described as "Brilliant...one of Britain's most inventive experimental theatre companies" and "unlike anything you've ever seen before", the company has created spectacular projects in a variety of locations all over the world, from New York's Brooklyn Bridge Anchorage to Dresden's historic Frauenkirche and <ENT>Salisbury<ENT> . More recently the work has been uniquely created for more intimate spaces in Europe, Asia and South America. Based in London, it is managed by Artsadmin.
Ramstein<SEP>Hansen and Watt were both awarded a Bronze Star, for running forward under fire to retrieve two fallen bodies. Sources differ on whether these were wounded American soldiers, including Morris, or the two Afghan militiamen shot at the outset. The five wounded men were awarded Purple Hearts. Speer was moved from Bagram airbase to <ENT>Ramstein<ENT> in Germany, where he was removed from life support on August 7 and died; his heart, liver, lungs and kidneys were donated for use by other patients.
Auschwitz<SEP>Whishaw was involved in many productions with Big Spirit, including If This is a Man (also performed as The Drowned & The Saved), a piece devised by the company based on the book of the same name by Primo Levi, a chemist, writer, and survivor of <ENT>Auschwitz<ENT> . It was adapted as a physical theatre piece by the group and taken to the 1995 Edinburgh Festival, where it garnered five-star reviews and great critical acclaim.
Warwick<SEP>In the grounds he added a thatched cottage and octagonal tower based on Guy's Tower at <ENT>Warwick<ENT> . The tower not only evoked the past visually through its medieval design but it also had strong historical associations of other kinds: for instance, it was intended to house a statue of Caractacus and was sited on the spot traditionally associated with the king raising the standard before the Battle of Edgehill.
Glamis<SEP>The Bowes-Lyon family had other major country houses, <ENT>Glamis<ENT> in Scotland, and Streatlam Castle, County Durham, relatively close to Gibside. By the late 19th century, Gibside was hardly used, and gradually fell into disrepair, irrevocably so in the case of the main house.
Dinosaur<SEP>In 1963, a reservoir, Lake Powell, was created by the construction of the Glen Canyon Dam, in the Arizona portion of Glen Canyon. This dam backed water into Utah, putting much of Glen Canyon under water hundreds of feet in depth. Lake Powell was not the result of negotiations over the controversial damming of the Green River within <ENT>Dinosaur<ENT> at Echo Park. The Echo Park Dam proposal was abandoned due to country wide citizen pressure on Congress to do so. Glen Canyon dam remains a central issue for modern environmentalist movements. Beginning in the late 1990s, the Sierra Club and other organizations renewed the call to dismantle the dam and drain Lake Powell in Lower Glen Canyon.
Salisbury<SEP>Early English roof bosses in <ENT>Salisbury<ENT> , England
Whitby<SEP>Having passed again by marriage to the Cholmeley family of <ENT>Whitby<ENT> , the house was remodelled in about 1775 for Nathaniel Cholmeley, possibly by John Carr. There is a Georgian brick extension at the back of the house and some of the windows have been altered so they have larger panes in the Georgian style. The parkland was laid out by Capability Brown in the 1770s for the Cholmeley family. In the grounds are three Giant Sequoia trees arranged in a triangle. These were given to a limited number of country estates in the seventeenth century. Sequoias were unknown to European horticulture till the middle of the 19th century, post the California goldrush.
Brookwood<SEP>Shapurji Saklatvala died, from another heart attack, on 16 January 1936 at his London home, 2 St Albans Villas, Highgate Road. He was 61 years old at the time of his death and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium. His remains were later buried on 21 January in the tomb of his mother at the Parsi burial ground in <ENT>Brookwood<ENT> , Woking.
Dachau<SEP>Germany also realized the national importance of design during World War II. Between 1933 and 1945 Adolf Hitler used design, architecture and propaganda to increase his power; shown through the annual Reichsparteitage in Nürnberg on September 5. Heinrich Himmler coordinated several design activities for Hitler, including: the all-black SS-uniform designed by Professor Karl Diebitsch and Walter Heck in 1933; <ENT>Dachau<ENT> , designed by Theodor Eicke, and prototypes for other Nazi concentration camps; and the Wewelsburg redesign commissioned by Heinrich Himmler in 1944.
Souda<SEP>Whidbey Island departed for her sixth Mediterranean deployment 15 September 1999. Along with 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit, Whidbey Island participated in Exercises Bright Star, Noble Shirley and Infinite Moonlight. During these exercises the ship worked in partnership with members of the British, Egyptian and Jordanian Armed Forces. Whidbey Island safely transited the Suez Canal as well as the Straits of Tiran, Toranto, Gibraltar, and of Messina, visiting ports such as Antalya, Turkey; Haifa, Israel; <ENT>Souda<ENT> , Greece; and Aqaba, Jordan.
Ascot<SEP>Three-year-old Red Rocks won a maiden stakes race in April 2006 at Windsor Racecourse and followed that up with another win in May's Fairway Stakes, a listed race at Newmarket. In June he was second in the King Edward VII Stakes at <ENT>Ascot<ENT> then in July ran second to Rail Link in the Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp Racecourse in Paris, France. After another second-place result in August's Great Voltigeur Stakes at York Racecourse, in September he was third in York's St. Leger Stakes. In November, Red Rocks was sent to Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. There, under jockey Frankie Dettori, he won the most important race of his career, the Breeders' Cup Turf. His win came over a strong international field that included Better Talk Now, English Channel, Cacique, and the 2005 World Champion, Hurricane Run.
Hedingham<SEP>Hoghton was the eldest son of Philip Hoghton and his first wife Elizabeth Slater, daughter of Thomas Slater of Denham, Lancashire, and was born on 22 October 1728. He was educated as a dissenter at Northampton academy. He married firstly Elizabeth Ashurst daughter of William Ashurst of <ENT>Hedingham<ENT> , Essex on 23 June 1760. She died on 19 May 1761. He married secondly  Fanny Booth, daughter of Daniel Booth of Hutton Hall, Essex, Governor of the Bank of England, on 8 July 1766. He succeeded his uncle Sir Henry Hoghton, 5th Baronet in the baronetcy on 23 February 1768.
Thornton<SEP>The gatehouse itself – "the finest in Norfolk and a smaller copy of that at <ENT>Thornton<ENT> " – dates from the 14th century and is a three-storey multi-unit lodging built of flint rubble with Barnack stone dressing.
Jax<SEP>In 1942, when the area was undeveloped, the U.S. Navy constructed four asphalt runways on the site and established a Naval Outlying Field designated as NOLF Fleming Island, an auxiliary airfield to <ENT>Jax<ENT> .  The Navy abandoned the auxiliary airfield in the 1960s, its runways too short to accommodate the jet aircraft then in operation at nearby NAS Jacksonville and NAS Cecil Field, and in the late 1990s the decaying runways were demolished to make way for current residential development.
Portland<SEP>Jurua was ordered by Brazil on 6 December 1937 from Vickers-Armstrongs, Barrow-in-Furness. The ship was laid down on 3 June 1938 and she was purchased by the British on 5 September 1939 and renamed HMS Handy. The ship was launched on 29 September 1939 and renamed Harvester in January 1940 as her original name was thought too liable to be confused with Hardy. Harvester was commissioned on 23 May and briefly worked up at <ENT>Portland<ENT> before she was assigned to the 9th Destroyer Flotilla.
Middlebury<SEP>Sidwell Friends has a century-long tradition of playing football, and plays in the MAAC.  Players have gone on to play college football at Columbia University, Franklin & Marshall College, Georgetown University, <ENT>Middlebury<ENT> , Kenyon College, Ithaca College, Stanford University, and Wake Forest University. Miles Brown, Sidwell and Wofford College graduate, in 2019 earned a place on the 53 man roster of the NFL Arizona Cardinals.
Arecibo<SEP>In 1951, Malott accepted the position of 6th president of Cornell University.  His 12-year term as president brought about the era of 'Big Science' at Cornell:  in 1961 sponsored research funding came to over $39 million.  His term also saw the construction of new campuses for the School of Labor Relations and the Colleges of Engineering and Veterinary Medicine as well as other major facilities, including <ENT>Arecibo<ENT> and Lynah Rink.  Though a social conservative, Malott was publicly very critical of McCarthyism; he saw it as a major threat to academic freedom.
Carnarvon<SEP>His Victoria Cross is displayed in the Royal Welch Fusiliers Museum in <ENT>Carnarvon<ENT> .
Shindand<SEP>According to the Wall Street Journal, the first 10 will be stationed at <ENT>Shindand<ENT> , in western Afghanistan. The other 10 are to go to Kandahar Airfield.
Falkner<SEP> <ENT>Falkner<ENT> was constructed in 1802 and commissioned by President Thomas Jefferson. The light is the second oldest in Connecticut and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The lighthouse was automated in 1978, and continues to operate as a navigational aid to the nearby Intracoastal Waterway. The island is part of the Stewart B. McKinney National Wildlife Refuge and has the fifth-largest colony of nesting roseate terns in the northeastern United States. Much of the island's land mass has been lost to erosion, down to about 2.87 acres (11,600 m) from its original 4.5 acres (18,000 m). The United States Army Corps of Engineers reinforced the eastern boundary to slow the advancing deterioration.
Los Alamos<SEP>Monte Carlo N-Particle Transport Code (MCNP) is a software package for simulating nuclear processes. It is developed by <ENT>Los Alamos<ENT> since at least 1957 with several further major improvements. It is distributed within the United States by the Radiation Safety Information Computational Center in Oak Ridge, TN and internationally by the Nuclear Energy Agency in Paris, France. It is used primarily for the simulation of nuclear processes, such as fission, but has the capability to simulate particle interactions involving neutrons, photons, and electrons among other particles. "Specific areas of application include, but are not limited to, radiation protection and dosimetry, radiation shielding, radiography, medical physics, nuclear criticality safety, detector design and analysis, nuclear oil well logging, accelerator target design, fission and fusion reactor design, decontamination and decommissioning."
Rock Island<SEP>The main gun was chosen after a comparative firing test on the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in 1957. Participating in the test were six guns: the 90 mm M41 (armament of the M48A2 although tested with the new T300E53 HEAT round mounted on an M48A2C tank), the 90 mm T208E9 (a smoothbore weapon firing T320E62 APFSDS mounted on the T95E1 tank), the 105 mm X15E8/T140 (a British gun developed from the 20 pdr mounted on the T95E2 tank), the 105 mm T254E1 (an American gun firing the same APDS ammunition as that of the British mounted on the T95E3 tank), the 120 mm T123E6 (a lightened variant of the M58 mounted on the T95E4 tank), and the 120 mm M58 (armament of the M103 heavy tank). The 120 mm T123E6 was preferred by the Ordnance Department because its ammunition, the same as that for the M58 gun, was already at an advanced state of development. The T123E6 however had a slow rate of fire as, unlike the M58 on the M103, there would only be one loader servicing it. This led to the weapon having a max rate of fire of 4 rpm vs. the T254's 7 rpm. The factors evaluated were accuracy, lethality of a hit, rate of fire and penetration performance. Based on these tests, the 105 mm T254E1 was selected, modified to the T254E2 and standardized as the M68E1. It used a vertical sliding breechblock instead of the T254E1's horizontal breechblock. Until American-made barrels could be obtained with comparable accuracy, British X15/L52 barrels were to be used. US built XM24/L52 barrels (length 218.5 inches) fitted with an eccentric bore evacuator were used for the M60-series starting in June 1959 but retained interchangeability with the British X15/L52 barrel. All of the US guns and XM24 barrels were produced at the Watervliet Arsenal, NY and the gun mounts (M116 for the M60 and M140 for the M60A1/A3) manufactured at the <ENT>Rock Island<ENT> , IL. US M68 guns were fitted with an eccentric bore evacuator instead of a concentric model in order to provide more clearance over the rear deck.  The gun is capable of using a wide range of ammunition including APDS-T (M932 and M728), APFSDS-T (M774 and M735), APFSDS-DU (M744A1 and M833), HEAT-FS (M456), APDS dummy and target practice rounds, HEP/HESH (M393), white phosphorus and canister rounds. Barrels with thermal sleeves were used starting in 1973.
Highclere<SEP>The Estate was sold in 1923 to Lady Carnarvon shortly after the untimely death of her husband, Lord Carnarvon, 5th Earl of Carnarvon. Lord Carnarvon broke into the Tutankhamun tombs in Egypt. He and his son died within a year of each other (the Tutankhamun curse). The Carnarvan family also own <ENT>Highclere<ENT> which is the shooting location of the hit TV show Downton Abbey. Lady Carnarvon set up Balchurn (Home Farm) as a model dairy farm. She and her soon to be her 2nd husband, Lt Colonel Ian Onslow Dennistoun also invested in grouse shooting.
Shinjuku<SEP>The name "Keio" (京王) is derived from taking one character each from the places through which the railway runs: "Tōkyō" (東京) and "Hachiōji" (八王子). The Keio railway network connects the western suburbs of Tokyo (Chōfu, Fuchū, Hachiōji, Hino, Inagi, Tama) and Sagamihara in Kanagawa with central Tokyo at <ENT>Shinjuku<ENT> .
Tabley<SEP>In 1804 Harrison made a series of plans for the rebuilding of Lowther Hall in Westmorland, but these were not accepted. However he was successful with his plans to enlarge and remodel Gredington, a house in North Wales, for Lord Kenyon, executed between 1807 and 1811 at a cost of £6,675 (equivalent to £480,000 in 2018).  Between 1808 and 1810 Harrison converted three rooms on the west side of the first floor of <ENT>Tabley<ENT> , near Knutsford, Cheshire, into a picture gallery for Sir John Fleming Leicester.  This was followed by a series of new houses, Oughtrington Hall, near Lymm, Cheshire, Woodbank, on the edge of Stockport (then in Cheshire), Glan-yr-Afon in Llanferres, North Wales, Dee Hills House in Chester, and Grove House in Allerton near Liverpool.
Southwell<SEP>The Rev. John Thomas Becher (born 1770 died 1848), was an English clergyman, social reformer and Vicar-General of <ENT>Southwell<ENT> from 1818 to 1840.
Jandakot<SEP>The Republic of Singapore Flying Club, Seletar Flying Club and Singapore Flying College are situated at Seletar Airport. The Singapore Flying College also conducts its flying training at <ENT>Jandakot<ENT> in Perth, Western Australia and at Sunshine Coast Airport in Maroochydore, Queensland. Another prominent flying school is the Singapore Youth Flying Club, which has its headquarters built on western side of the airport's runway. Completed in June 2003, the clubhouse also has its own parking bays for its fleet of Diamond DA40. Also, the rotary training unit of Republic Of Singapore Air Force – 124 Squadron, has a training detachment at the civilian airport although it is normally headquartered at Sembawang Air Base.
Dachau<SEP>Leclerc objected to the use of his troops in the attack on Royan in April 1945. As a result, only part of 2e DB was employed. The division rejoined Seventh Army, crossing the Rhine on 25 April, and joining the pursuit into Bavaria. Leclerc visited <ENT>Dachau<ENT> after its liberation by the Americans. In an incident that took place 8 May 1945 at Karlstein near Bad Reichenhall in Bavaria, he was presented with a defiant group of captured Frenchmen of the SS Charlemagne Division. He asked them why they wore a German uniform, to which one of them replied by asking why Leclerc wore an American one. Leclerc told his men to get rid of them. That was taken as a death sentence. The group of French Waffen-SS men was summarily executed by the RMT without any form of military tribunal procedure, and their bodies left where they fell until an American burial team collected them three days later. On 2 June 1949 the bodies were exhumed and buried in the St. Zeno cemetery in Bad Reichenhall. For his services leading the 2e DB, Leclerc was awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour.
North Greenwich<SEP>In December 2007, Leo moved <ENT>North Greenwich<ENT> , taking up the post of Senior Booker for AEG Live.
Northwick<SEP>Donnai studied at St Mary's Hospital Medical School, then trained in paediatrics at St Mary’s Hospital, <ENT>Northwick<ENT> and in Sheffield.
Lambeth<SEP>The current structure, a five-span steel arch, designed by engineer Sir George Humphreys and  architects Sir Reginald Blomfield and G. Topham Forrest, was built by Dorman Long and opened on 19 July 1932 by King George V. It formerly carried four lanes of road traffic (now reduced to three lanes, one of which is a buses-only lane flowing eastbound) from a roundabout junction by <ENT>Lambeth<ENT> northwards to another roundabout, where the Millbank road meets Horseferry Road .
Portland<SEP>The container ship MSC Napoli, whilst on its way to Portugal carrying 2,394 containers, of which 158 were classed as hazardous substances, had to be abandoned in the English Channel on the 18th. The crew of 26 were picked up by British and French rescue services. The next day the Napoli was under tow for repair at <ENT>Portland<ENT> in Dorset, but with forecasts of further high winds it was taken to shelter in Lyme Bay. The ship had suffered structural damage, including a 1 m by 0.5 m (3 ft by 1 ft 6 in) hole on the starboard side and water flooding and had to be beached in the bay 1-mile (1.6 km) off the East Devon coast at Branscombe The ship leaked oil, sparking a clean-up operation, and widespread reporting in the national news led to the wreck temporarily becoming a tourist attraction and subject to scavenging from the containers which washed up on the beach. The wreck was subject to a complex break-up operation which was not complete until July 2009.
Oak Ridge atomic plant<SEP>In December 2004, the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) team in Dubna, Moscow Oblast, Russia, proposed a joint experiment with <ENT>Oak Ridge atomic plant<ENT> (ORNL) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, United States, to synthesize element 117—so-called for the 117 protons in its nucleus. Their proposal involved fusing a berkelium (element 97) target and a calcium (element 20) beam, conducted via bombardment of the berkelium target with calcium nuclei: this would complete a set of experiments done at the JINR on the fusion of actinide targets with a calcium-48 beam, which had thus far produced the new elements 113–116 and 118. The ORNL—then the world's only producer of berkelium—could not then provide the element, as they had temporarily ceased production, and re-initiating it would be too costly. Plans to synthesize element 117 were suspended in favor of the confirmation of element 118, which had been produced earlier in 2002 by bombarding a californium target with calcium. The required berkelium-249 is a by-product in californium-252 production, and obtaining the required amount of berkelium was an even more difficult task than obtaining that of californium, as well as costly: it would cost around 3.5 million dollars, and the parties agreed to wait for a commercial order of californium production, from which berkelium could be extracted.
Ely<SEP>The first Cluniac Priory church was a reconstruction in stone of a Saxon timber church. This may correspond to the single cell structure of which the lower sections of wall and the altar survive, now known as the Infirmary Chapel. This is orientated to a different liturgical east from the major church (which is 5.5 degrees closer to current magnetic east) but the same orientation as that of St Michael, Lewes, also a Saxon foundation and of St John, Southover. By the twelfth century it had become the practice to orient a church to face the rising sun on the day of the saint in whose name the church was dedicated, in this case, 12 May, to which orientation the major church appears to have been aligned. The major church was constructed after 1140 AD with the west towers recorded as unfinished in 1268 AD. Of this work nothing survives above ground level. The design of the church was based upon that of its mother church at Cluny, then the largest church in the world, now referred to as Cluny III. Comparison with the surviving Romanesque fabric of the daughter Priory of Castle Acre is relevant. The church had an internal length of 128m (420 feet) from west door to chancel apse, with an internal vault height of 28m (93 feet) at the altar and 32m (105 feet) at the crossing. This was the largest church in Sussex, being longer than Chichester Cathedral including its Lady Chapel, and is comparable in scale to the original form of <ENT>Ely<ENT> or the surviving form of Lichfield Cathedral.
Ohio<SEP>She was born in Richfield, Minnesota and grew up in a family of collegiate basketball players. Her father, Gary King, played at the University of Nebraska at Kearney. Her brother, Stephen, played at <ENT>Ohio<ENT> .
South Bank<SEP>The manuscript score of Urantia is dated 21 February 2007, making it very likely the first of the Klang solo pieces with electronics to have been completed (Siano 2013, 46). It was premiered in the Queen Elizabeth Hall at <ENT>South Bank<ENT> , London, on 8 November 2008, by Kathinka Pasveer, soprano (prerecorded) and sound projection (Kohl 2008, 21).
Southwark<SEP>A staunch Anglo-Catholic, Weston was the chaplain and then principal of St Andrew's College, additionally serving as chancellor of Zanzibar Cathedral from 1904 to 1908, before being ordained to the episcopate in 1908. He was consecrated bishop in <ENT>Southwark<ENT> on 18 October the same year. Under his auspices, a Swahili edition of the Book of Common Prayer for use in Zanzibar was issued in 1919.
Hejaz<SEP>The Sulayhid dynasty was founded in the northern highlands around 1040 CE. At the time, Yemen was ruled by different local dynasties. In 1060, Ali ibn Mohammed Al-Sulayhi conquered Zabid and killed its ruler Al-Najah, founder of the Najahid dynasty, whose sons were forced to flee to Dahlak. Hadramawt fell into Sulayhid hands after their capture of Aden in 1062. By 1063, Ali had subjugated Greater Yemen. He then marched toward <ENT>Hejaz<ENT> and occupied Makkah. Ali was married to Asma bint Shihab, who governed Yemen with her husband. The Khutba during Friday prayers was proclaimed in her husband's and her name. No other Arab woman had this honor since the advent of Islam.
Uppsala<SEP>He passed the studentexamen at Östra Real and received a Candidate of Law degree from <ENT>Uppsala<ENT> and a Master of Business Administration degree from Harvard Business School in United States in 1970 together with Endre Røsjø. After Harvard, Stenbeck went to work for Morgan Stanley & Co Inc. in New York City from 1970 to 1976 and then his career in business continued with the formation of the mobile phone company Millicom.
Sarum<SEP>The land of the parish has traditionally been owned by the owner of Sherborne Castle, so past owners have included Sir Walter Raleigh and bishops of <ENT>Sarum<ENT> . Residents of the parish previously had to take the deceased to Sherborne Abbey for burial; this arrangement stopped in 1618.
Dachau<SEP>Eicke served as the second commandant of <ENT>Dachau<ENT> from June 1933 to July 1934, and together with his adjutant Michael Lippert, was one of the executioners of SA Chief Ernst Röhm during the Night of the Long Knives purge. In 1939, Eicke became commander of the SS Division Totenkopf of the Waffen-SS, leading the division during the Second World War on the Western and Eastern fronts, and continuing to expand and develop the concentration camp system.
Stirling<SEP>The Duke of Albany died in 1420 in <ENT>Stirling<ENT> and lies buried in Dunfermline Abbey in Fife. He was succeeded as Duke of Albany and Regent of Scotland by his son, Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany. But Murdoch would not enjoy his power for long. In 1425 the exiled King James, captive in England for 18 years, finally returned to Scotland, and executed Murdoch and most of his family for treason, causing the almost complete ruin of the Albany Stewarts.
Plymouth<SEP>He began teaching at <ENT>Plymouth<ENT> in 2006. MacLeish, along with social worker Celia Woolverton, have a mediation firm whose goal is to "keep parties out of court."
Uppsala<SEP>Nilson was born in Skönberga parish in Östergötland, Sweden. His father, Nikolaus, was a farmer. The family moved to Gotland when Lars Fredrik was young. After graduating from school, Lars Fredrik enrolled at <ENT>Uppsala<ENT> , and there he studied the natural sciences. His talent for chemistry drew attention from chemistry professor Lars Fredrik Svanberg, who was a former student of Jöns Jakob Berzelius.
Rock Island<SEP>The US Army adopted the French 75 mm field gun during World War I and used it extensively in battle. The US designation of the basic weapon was 75 mm Gun M1897. There were 480 American 75 mm field gun batteries (over 1,900 guns) on the battlefields of France in November 1918. Manufacture of the French 75 by American industry began in the spring of 1918 and quickly built up to an accelerated pace. Carriages were built by Willys-Overland, the hydro-pneumatic recuperators by Singer Manufacturing Company and <ENT>Rock Island<ENT> , the cannon itself by Symington-Anderson and Wisconsin Gun Company. American industry built 1,050 French 75s during World War I, but only 143 had been shipped to France by 11 November 1918; most American batteries used French-built 75s in action.
Stirling<SEP>In 1423 Thomas Somerville, as Lord of Carnwath, came to London as an ambassador to treat for the release of James I of Scotland, who had been captive in England for many years. Somerville was also recorded as a Warden of the Scottish Borders in 1424. As Somerville of that Ilk, he sat on the assize at <ENT>Stirling<ENT> in May 1425 that condemned Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany. Thomas Somerville probably founded the Collegiate Church at Carnwath with his family burial aisle around 1425-1430, and repaired the church at Linton, Roxburghshire.
Warwick<SEP>Both Lord Willoughby and his father supported the King and raised a regiment of cavalry in Lincolnshire on his behalf. Lord Willoughby commanded the Life Guards at Edgehill, where his father was mortally wounded by a shot through the thigh. Willoughby surrendered to the Parliamentarians in order to attend his father, whom he now succeeded as Earl of Lindsey and Lord Great Chamberlain. He was imprisoned in <ENT>Warwick<ENT> , where he wrote a defiant declaration and justification of his loyalty to the King. He was not released until a prisoner exchange in July 1643, whereupon he rejoined the King at Oxford and was appointed a Privy Counsellor in December. As colonel of the King's Life Guards of Foot and subsequently lieutenant-general of the Life Guards "and all the foot", he fought at the First Battle of Newbury, Cropredy Bridge, Lostwithiel, Second Battle of Newbury, and was wounded at Naseby. In addition to his military services for the King, Lindsey frequently acted as a commissioner to treat with Parliament and persistently urged reconciliation. The King  additionally honored Lindsey with the post of Gentleman of the Bedchamber from 1643 until 1649, and Steward, Keeper and Ranger of Woodstock in 1644.
Middlebury<SEP>In 1996, this interest was expressed in other ways as well. Georgetown University began offering a related master's program in that year, and at the University of Maryland, David Silver created the Resource Center for Cyberculture Studies on the web. <ENT>Middlebury<ENT> developed Politics of Virtual Realities, one of the first undergraduate courses dedicated to exploring the political, legal and normative implications of the Internet for liberal democracy. By 2001, The Chronicle of Higher Education noted that "internet studies" was emerging as a discipline in its own right, as suggested by the first undergraduate program in the area, offered at Brandeis University, and noted that "perhaps the most telling sign of the field's momentum" was the popularity of the annual conference created by the then nascent Association of Internet Researchers.
Stirling<SEP>The West Dean Tapestry Studio was established in 1974 to provide high-level craft-based programmes in woven tapestry,  one of only a very small number of such studios worldwide. Their first major commission were The Henry Moore Tapestries. Tapestries woven by the studio are in the Palace of Westminster, Great Ormond Street Hospital and Chelmsford Cathedral. As well as new designs, the Studio is also engaged in recreating the 16th-century 'The Hunt of the Unicorn' tapestries, part of a twelve-year project for Historic Scotland, for the refurbishment of <ENT>Stirling<ENT> . The Studio wove a tapestry for Tracey Emin based on her Black Cat painting; it was shown at the Saatchi Gallery in May 2011.
Ely<SEP>He was associated with Augustus Welby Pugin in restoring the choir of Jesus College chapel; the designs were made principally by Rattee, and submitted to Pugin before execution. In the choir of <ENT>Ely<ENT> he carried out the designs of George Gilbert Scott, and the oak screen, stalls, organ-case, and restored tomb of Bishop William de Luda or Louth (d. 1298) were exquisitely wrought.
Winchester<SEP>In 2012 Marvin Ayres embarked on Sacred Spaces, a series of conceptual installations and recordings in incongruous spaces- an evolving project. He has recorded on location on HMS Alliance, H.M.S.Victory, The Concorde,  Bush House, Greenwich Observatory, <ENT>Winchester<ENT> . Orford Ness and Usk Lighthouse. In radio interviews on the BBC and in local press Marvin has explained how he intends to create one collective piece composed from the overtones, sustains and reverberations recorded in each environment and return to exhibit 3D sound installations (created in his Wall of Waves studio) at the locations at a later stage.
Beverly<SEP>The most outstanding feature of the interior is the tomb in the south aisle, much mutilated by being reset into the wall. Indeed one side is now exposed on the exterior wall of the church. Dating to c. 1340-50, it commemorates a priest, thought to be either William de la Mare, Provost of Beverley or his brother Thomas, vicar of Welwick. It is of the highest quality and enriched with flowing tracery, foliate carving, figures of saints and angels, the symbols of the Evangelists and the Passion, and heraldry. Under an ogee canopy with a ribbed vault lies the effigy of a priest in mass vestments. Pevsner attributes the monument to one of the carvers of the Percy tomb in <ENT>Beverly<ENT> , and assigns the south doorway with its sculpture (described above) to the same Beverley workshop which produced these tombs. The Beverley workshop supplied numerous sculptures and monuments to churches throughout the region. As an example, see the statue of the Virgin in St Patrick's Church, Patrington.
Rochester<SEP>Probably from about 1190, Gilbert de Glanville (bishop 1185–1214) commenced the rebuilding of the east end and the replacement on the monastic buildings. The north quire transept may have been sufficiently advanced to allow the burial of St William of Perth in 1201, alternatively the coffin may have lain in the north quire aisle until the transept was ready. It was then looted in 1215 by the forces of King John during siege of <ENT>Rochester<ENT> . Edmund de Hadenham recounts that there was not a pyx left "in which the body of the Lord might rest upon the altar". However, by 1227, the quire was again in use when the monks made their solemn entry into it. The cathedral was rededicated in 1240 by Richard Wendene (also known as Richard de Wendover) who had been translated from Bangor.
Southampton<SEP>The city was also home to the Royal Naval Engineering College; opened in 1880 in Keyham, it trained engineering students for five years before they completed the remaining two years of the course at Greenwich. The college closed in 1910, but in 1940 a new college opened at Manadon. This was renamed Dockyard Technical College in 1959 before finally closing in 1994; training was transferred to <ENT>Southampton<ENT> .
Edmonton<SEP>A massive cluster of thunderstorms occurred on July 11, 2004, with large hail and over 100 mm (4 in) of rain reported within the space of an hour in many places.  This "1-in-200 year event" flooded major intersections and underpasses and damaged both residential and commercial properties. The storm caused extensive damage to <ENT>Edmonton<ENT> ; a small glass section of the roof collapsed under the weight of the rainwater, causing water to drain onto the mall's indoor ice rink. As a result, the mall was evacuated as a precautionary measure.
Brookfield<SEP>In Illinois the celebration of the "often disrespected species" is done with "good reason": the pork industry contributes $1.9 billion to the state's economy. When National Pig Day coincided with the Year of the Pig in 2007, described as a porcine nexus, Illinoisans watched a 50 lb (23 kg) miniature pig named Pinto from the Yucatan display sporting abilities (guiding a ball into a soccer net and using his snout to push a basketball up a ramp into a hoop) at <ENT>Brookfield<ENT> and many fans donned pig snouts and caps for the festivities and parade.
Carnoustie<SEP>Langasque won The Amateur Championship in 2015 at <ENT>Carnoustie<ENT> , beating Grant Forrest 4&2 in the final.
Gallipoli<SEP>During the First World War her son Bertram was wounded at <ENT>Gallipoli<ENT> . She travelled to Egypt to be closer to him; when she arrived she noticed the lack of facilities for the troops and established a canteen in the Cairo suburb of Heliopolis largely at her own expense.
Penang<SEP>The district is linked with the Malay Peninsula via <ENT>Penang<ENT> , which runs between the George Town suburb of Gelugor and Perai on the mainland.
Agra<SEP>Musamman Burj also known as the Saman Burj or the Shah-burj, is an octagonal tower standing close to the Shah Jahan's private hall Diwan-e-Khas in <ENT>Agra<ENT> .
Los Alamos<SEP>The Signpost has been the subject of academic analysis in publications including Sociological Forum, the social movements journal Interface, and New Review of Academic Librarianship; and was consulted for data on Wikipedia by researchers from <ENT>Los Alamos<ENT> and Dartmouth College. It has garnered generally positive reception from media publications including The New York Times, The Register, Nonprofit Quarterly, and Heise Online. The book Wikipedia: The Missing Manual called The Signpost essential reading for ambitious new Wikipedia editors.
Ramstein<SEP>After World War II, the area was occupied by the US Army and renamed Camp Lindsey (after Captain Darrell R. Lindsey). U.S. Air Forces Europe (USAFE), however, retained a small presence at Lindsey Air Station. Lindsey AS was established as a U.S. Army Air Forces installation on 13 November 1946, became a U.S. Air Force installation in 1947, and achieved its greatest prominence between December 1953 and 14 March 1973 when it was the host base for USAFE Headquarters. On that date USAFE Headquarters moved to <ENT>Ramstein<ENT> .
Wembley<SEP>Apart from television and film work, he starred in the music video of Westlife's version of "Uptown Girl" (2001) alongside Claudia Schiffer. On 7 July 2007 he was a presenter at the UK leg of Live Earth at <ENT>Wembley<ENT> , London.
Rosemont<SEP>On August 4, 2007, Morales fought David Díaz for the WBC Lightweight title and lost a close unanimous decision at <ENT>Rosemont<ENT> . Judges Herminio, Cuevas Collazo and Robert Hecko both scored Round 1, 10–9 Morales, even though Morales knocked down Díaz in that round. Collazo then went on to score Round 2, 10–8 for Diaz, when not only did a knockdown not occur, but the two other judges saw it as a Morales round. The final scores read  114–113 (Collazo), 115–113 (Hecko) and 115–112 (Uratani), all in favor of Díaz. It was Morales' fifth loss in his last six bouts. During the post-fight press conference, Morales announced his retirement from boxing.
Luton<SEP>Although monumental sculpture is extremely rare in Byzantine art, the Macedonian period saw the unprecedented flourishing of the art of ivory sculpture. Many ornate ivory triptychs and diptychs survive, with the central panel often representing either deesis (as in the Harbaville Triptych) or the Theotokos (as in a triptych at <ENT>Luton<ENT> , dating from the reign of Nicephorus Phocas). On the other hand, ivory caskets (notably the Veroli Casket from Victoria and Albert Museum) often feature secular motifs true to the Hellenistic tradition, thus testifying to an undercurrent of classical taste in Byzantine art.
Hejaz<SEP>The 12th century Muslim historian Muhammad al-Shahrastani mentions Jews living in nearby Medina and <ENT>Hejaz<ENT> who accepted Jesus as a prophetic figure and followed traditional Judaism, rejecting mainstream Christian views. Some scholars argue that they contributed to the development of the Islamic view of Jesus due to exchanges of Ebionite remnants with the first Muslims.
Portland<SEP>HMS Gorgon was the first ship completed and she served as tender to HMS Cambridge, the gunnery school ship at Devonport, from 1874 to 1877. All four ships were commissioned between April and August 1878 during the war scare during the Russo-Turkish War for service with Admiral Sir Cooper Key's Particular Service Squadron in <ENT>Portland<ENT> . She resumed her duties as tender to HMS Cambridge until she was refitted in 1888–89. All four of the ships of the class participated in the annual fleet manoeuvers in 1887, 1889–90 and 1892; in between times they were in Fleet Reserve. HMS Gorgon, like all of her sisters, was placed on the non-effective list in 1901 and sold in 1903 for £8,400.
Dachau<SEP>In 1938, the school got a new building, designed by Alois Degano, and was renamed Reichsschule der NSDAP Feldafing (RSF). The school was sponsored by the leadership of the Nazi Party.  In 1942, an addition to <ENT>Dachau<ENT> was constructed on adjacent property.
Williamsburg<SEP>Barney partnered with Chapman no later than 1892. He was involved with the restoration of <ENT>Williamsburg<ENT> and drew up plans for the restoration of the Bruton Parish Church in 1904 on a pro bono basis. He designed the Emmet Building at 95 Madison Avenue in association with S. R. Colt and it was completed in 1912. It became a New York City Landmark in 2018.
Salamanca<SEP>Gil Blas is born in misery to a stablehand and a chambermaid of Santillana in Cantabria, and is educated by his uncle. He leaves Oviedo at the age of seventeen to attend <ENT>Salamanca<ENT> . His bright future is suddenly interrupted when he is forced to help robbers along the route and is faced with jail.
Arecibo<SEP>During 2001, 114 Kassandra was observed by radar from <ENT>Arecibo<ENT> . The return signal matched an effective diameter of 100 ± 14 km. This is consistent with the asteroid dimensions computed through other means.
Charing Cross<SEP>The Spice of Life is a pub at Cambridge Circus in London's <ENT>Charing Cross<ENT> . The pub was founded as The George & Thirteen Cantons in or before 1759, and later became The Scots Hoose. By 1975 it had been renamed The Spice of Life.
Glastonbury<SEP>On 11 September 1275, an earthquake struck the south of Great Britain. The epicentre is unknown, although it may have been in the Portsmouth/Chichester area on the south coast of England or in Glamorgan, Wales. The earthquake is known for causing the destruction of St Michael's Church on <ENT>Glastonbury<ENT> in Somerset.
Williamsburg<SEP>The Corporation for Jefferson's Poplar Forest is using early 19th century building materials including heavy timber fram construction, hemp sash cord, iron hardware from <ENT>Williamsburg<ENT> as well as 19th century building techniques in their restoration work including column rendering and burning limestone to produce traditional lime mortar and plaster. The goal of the restorations is to restore Poplar Forest to Jefferson's original architectural vision.
Lambeth<SEP>By spring 1550 Ponet was rehabilitated, and preached before the king. In March 1550, he was nominated as bishop of Rochester, and was consecrated at <ENT>Lambeth<ENT> on 29 June. In January 1551, he was appointed to a commission to investigate anabaptists in Kent.
Ramstein<SEP>Durant was a member of the Bush-Cheney '04 Veterans Team and the McCain '08 Veterans team. In this political capacity for McCain, he criticized the presumptive Democratic Presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, for having cancelled a planned trip to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC) near <ENT>Ramstein<ENT> in Germany where he had intended, while in Europe, to visit American casualties of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Durant said he thought this was inappropriate for a potential commander in chief. Obama felt that he did not want to exploit the visit for the benefit of his campaign, prior to the election, but he did telephone those recovering military patients there and also paid a visit to a military hospital in Baghdad and to troops in Afghanistan. Retired two-star Air Force general Scott Gration, who advised the campaign and traveled with Obama on the trip said: "Senator Obama did not want to have a trip to see our wounded warriors perceived as a campaign event when his visit was to show his appreciation for our troops and decided instead not to go."
Hedingham<SEP>The Medieval Siege Society are an active society who take part in a number of events over the season, including Tewkesbury medieval festival, St Albans <ENT>Hedingham<ENT> , Dover Castle Eltham Palace and England’s Medieval Festival at Herstmonceux Castle.
Ascot<SEP>Sports venues such as stadiums and racetracks also have royal boxes or enclosures, for example at the All England Club <ENT>Ascot<ENT> , where access is limited to royal families or other distinguished personalities. In other countries, sports venues have luxury boxes, where access is open to anyone who can afford tickets.  Additionally, some sports venues were themselves called auditoria, such as the former Buffalo Memorial Auditorium.
South Bank<SEP>In 2013, Bowart was again invited to participate at the London International Mime Festival.  His season of Letter's End at <ENT>South Bank<ENT> marked the production's UK premiere. (see review) The French premiere of "Letter's End" followed soon after, during a tour that included dates at the 2013 Festival Effervescences alongside works by Philippe Genty, Daniele Finzi Pasca and James Thiérrée.
Salisbury<SEP>In October 2011, Songs of Praise broadcast "Whispers in a Dream" and "Amazing Grace" performed by Westenra in <ENT>Salisbury<ENT> . On 31 October 2011, Westenra was featured on André Rieu classical music album And the Waltz Goes On with the only vocal track "Dreaming of New Zealand."
Southampton<SEP>Attlee suffered badly from dyslexia, and was a poor student as a child. His father chose to tackle this issue by having his son educated at Millfield School, which under its founding headmaster, the educationalist R. J. O. Meyer, was noted for its progressive approach to reading problems. Attlee did well enough to study at the school of navigation at what is now <ENT>Southampton<ENT> , and served from 1945 to 1950 in the merchant navy. After a spell working for Iberian Airways, among other companies, he eventually joined British Rail's southern region, working for a long time in its public relations department; it was this experience that prompted him to write his book Bluff Your Way in PR (1971).
Oak Ridge<SEP>The Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences (CNMS) at <ENT>Oak Ridge<ENT> (ORNL) is a U.S.Department of Energy / Office of Science Nanoscale Science Research Center (NSRC) operating as a highly collaborative and multidisciplinary user research facility.  The CNMS is one of five DOE NSRCs that form an integrated national user network. Each NSRC is associated with other major national research facilities at one of DOE’s National Laboratories, enabling their application to nanoscale science and technology.
Westminster<SEP>The House of Commons, officially the Honourable the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in Parliament assembled, is the lower house of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Like the upper house, the House of Lords, it meets in <ENT>Westminster<ENT> . Owing to shortage of space, its office accommodation extends into Portcullis House.
Sandringham<SEP>The idea for a Christmas message from the sovereign to the British Empire was first proposed by the "founding father" of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), John Reith, in 1922 when he approached King George V about making a short broadcast on the newly created radio service. The King declined, however, believing that radio was mainly an entertainment. Reith approached the King again ten years later, in 1932, as a way to inaugurate the Empire Service (now the World Service) and the King finally agreed after being encouraged to do so by Queen Mary and Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. That year, George V read the first Royal Christmas Message; the King was originally hesitant about using the relatively untested medium of radio, but was reassured after a summertime visit to the BBC and agreed to carry out the concept and read the speech from a temporary studio set up at <ENT>Sandringham<ENT> . The broadcast was introduced from Ilmington Manor by 65-year-old Walton Handy, a local shepherd, with carols from the church choir and the bells ringing from the town church, and reached an estimated 20 million people in Australia, Canada, India, Kenya, South Africa, and the UK.
Charing Cross<SEP>In 1995 the owners of the Astoria in London's <ENT>Charing Cross<ENT> asked the duo to produce Friday nights at the LA2 club within the Astoria complex. The club's opening night featured free entry, leading to a capacity crowd. Under a strict policy of "no live bands," the club went on to run with weekly capacity crowds for the next five years. The club attracted more than 300,000 customers over its lifespan; hours-long entry queues of hundreds of people were common. Popscene's DJ sets laid the foundations for the rock/dance crossover of the next decade; the tagline on many of the distinctive (and now highly collectable) flyers was "the dance club for people who like bands".
NYC<SEP>Production designer Bo Welch designed the M.I.B. headquarters with a 1960s tone in mind, because that was when their organization is formed. He cited influences from Finnish architect Eero Saarinen, who designed a terminal at <ENT>NYC<ENT> . As the arrival point of aliens on Earth, Welch felt M.I.B. HQ had to resemble an airport.
Shinagawa<SEP>An alternative to the monorail is the Keikyu Airport Line between the airport and <ENT>Shinagawa<ENT> . Both railways compete with bus services.
Ramstein<SEP>Manas air base operations began 16 December 2001 and included the 86th Contingency Response Group from <ENT>Ramstein<ENT> , Germany as well as contractors and French engineers. Since then it has hosted forces from Australia, Denmark, France, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, Spain and the Netherlands. Coalition aircraft previously based here have included tankers (KC-135s), tactical airlift (C-130s), fighters (F-18, F-16, Mirage 2000) and helicopters (Super Puma).
San Siro<SEP>On 25 August 2010, Cudicini saw his first official action for the club in nearly a year as a half-time replacement for the injured Gomes in the second leg of Tottenham's UEFA Champions League play-off round tie against Young Boys of Switzerland. Three days later, he started against Wigan Athletic in the Premier League at White Hart Lane but was criticised for conceding the Latics' winning goal scored by Hugo Rodallega. Despite putting in some consistently good performances for Spurs, he was again benched in favour of Gomes for the Champions League group stage match against Twente on 29 September. He was an eighth-minute replacement for Luka Modrić after Gomes' sending-off against Internazionale on 20 October, but was powerless to stop the defending Champions League winners from scoring three times in a 4–3 loss at <ENT>San Siro<ENT> . He went on to play in the return match on 2 November at White Hart Lane as 'Spurs earned a famous 3–1 victory. On 10 May 2011, Cudicini gave a very solid performance against Manchester City at Eastlands. He made two good saves to deny City a winning goal, but Tottenham still lost 1–0 through an own goal from Peter Crouch.
Southwark<SEP>Khan was officially sworn in as Mayor in a multi-faith ceremony held in <ENT>Southwark<ENT> the following day. His first act as mayor was his appearance at a Holocaust memorial ceremony in a rugby stadium in North London, although due to delays with the results of the election, he officially took office on 9 May.
Winchester<SEP>Ramsey was born on 22 February 1903 in Cambridge where his father Arthur Stanley Ramsey (1867–1954), also a mathematician, was President of Magdalene College. His mother was Mary Agnes Stanley (1875–1927). He was the eldest of two brothers and two sisters, and his brother Michael Ramsey, the only one of the four siblings who was to remain Christian, later became Archbishop of Canterbury. He entered <ENT>Winchester<ENT> in 1915 and later returned to Cambridge to study mathematics at Trinity College. While studying mathematics at Trinity College, Ramsey became a student to John Maynard Keynes, and an active member in the Apostles, a Cambridge discussion group. In 1923, he received his bachelor's degree in mathematics, passing his examinations with the result of first class with distinction.  He was named Senior Wrangler. Easy-going, simple and modest, Ramsey had many interests besides his scientific work. Even as a teenager Ramsey exhibited both a profound ability and, as attested by his brother, an extremely diverse range of interests:
Uppsala<SEP>Zennström has dual degrees in Business Administration (BSc) from <ENT>Uppsala<ENT> and Engineering Physics (MSc) from the KTH Royal Institute of Technology. He spent his final year at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, US.
Mackinac<SEP>On March 22, 1805, President Thomas Jefferson appointed Hull as Governor of the recently created Michigan Territory and as its Indian Agent. All of the territory was in the hands of the Indians except for two enclaves around Detroit and <ENT>Mackinac<ENT> , so Hull worked to gradually purchase Indian land for occupation by American settlers. He negotiated the Treaty of Detroit in 1807 with the Ottawa, Chippewa, Wyandot, and Potawatomi tribes, which ceded most of Southeast Michigan and northwestern Ohio to the United States, to the mouth of the Maumee River where Toledo developed. These efforts to expand American settlement began to generate opposition, particularly from Shawnee leaders Tecumseh and his brother Tenskwatawa, who urged resistance to American culture and to further land cessions.
Tredegar<SEP>In 1859 Joseph R. Anderson of <ENT>Tredegar<ENT> , Richmond, Virginia and Junius L. Archer of the Bellona Foundry, Midlothian, Virginia (the only two gun foundries then operating in what would become the Confederacy) failed to adopt the Rodman technique of hollow casting, and as result the U.S. Army cancelled contracts with both firms for casting columbiads. Therefore, at the outbreak of the war, southern foundries were not capable of casting guns using the Rodman method.
Cardiff City<SEP>Keenor was released by Cardiff at the end of the 1930–31 season, which saw the club relegated to the Third Division South. During his time at Cardiff, he made more than 500 appearances for the club, winning four Welsh Cup titles, the FA Cup and the FA Charity Shield in a 19-year association with the side. He is regarded as one of the club's all-time greats.

Auschwitz<SEP>While in Francoist Spain, Degrelle maintained a high standard of living and frequently appeared in public and private meetings in a white uniform featuring his German decorations, while expressing his pride over his close contacts and "thinking bond" with Adolf Hitler. He continued to live undisturbed when Spain transitioned to democracy after the death of Franco, and continued publishing polemics, voicing his support for the political far right. He became active in the Neo-Nazi Círculo Español de Amigos de Europa (Cedade) and ran its printing press in Barcelona, where he published a large portion of his writings, including an Open Letter to Pope John Paul II on the topic of <ENT>Auschwitz<ENT> , asking the Pope not to go.

Dachau<SEP>Her father was an infantry officer who also served as an intelligence officer and played a key role in the transition of the United States' intelligence service from the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). As a US Army colonel in World War II, he helped coordinate the invasion of southern France in 1944 and captured Hermann Göring. Though he was not present, his regiment liberated <ENT>Dachau<ENT> ; he arrived the next day, when he heard the news. From 1964 to 1966, he commanded the Seventh Army in Germany. Quinn wrote about his career in an autobiography, Buffalo Bill Remembers.
El Escorial<SEP>Soon after the Duke of Seville again expressed leftist ideas in 1860, he again went in exile to France. There he obtained the rank of Captain General of the army, and three years later he was promoted to Lieutenant General. In 1863 his wife died after giving birth to their fifth child, and was buried in the Convent of Las Descalzas Reales, rather than in the Spanish royal tombs at <ENT>El Escorial<ENT> , reserved for queens and infantas of Spain.
Brookwood<SEP>Following his death on 28 March 1913, his funeral took place on 1 April 1913.

He was tried and convicted of heresy in the retroquire of <ENT>Southwark<ENT> in 1543 but received a pardon owing to the intervention of the Bishop of Winchester, Stephen Gardner.
Salisbury<SEP>Seward became travelling tutor to Lord Charles FitzRoy, third son of Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton, who died while on the tour in Italy in 1739. The Duke promised some preferment for Seward: he became rector of Eyam in Derbyshire, and Kingsley, Staffordshire. He also obtained the prebend of Bubbenhall in Lichfield Cathedral, though the date of his admission does not appear, and on 30 April 1755 he was collated to the prebend of Pipa Parva in the same church. He was installed in the prebend of Lyme and Halstock in <ENT>Salisbury<ENT> on 5 June 1755.
Wells<SEP>The school has an eight-part choir, typically performing choral works ranging from the early works of Thomas Tallis through Joseph Haydn's Insanae et Vanae Curae to the recent works of composers such as John Tavener. The choir visits cathedrals around the country annually, where it sings services for the week whilst the resident choir is away. These have included Chester, York, Blackburn, Salisbury, and Liverpool. The choir has sung mass in St Mark's Basilica, Venice. In the summer of 2007 the choir visited <ENT>Wells<ENT> .

Warwick<SEP>The largest currently-functioning trebuchet in the world is the 22-tonne machine at <ENT>Warwick<ENT> , England, constructed in 2005. Based on historical designs, it stands 18 metres (59 ft) tall and throws missiles typically 36 kg (80 lbs) up to 300 metres (980 ft). The trebuchet gained significant interest from numerous news sources when in 2015 a burning missile fired from the siege engine struck and damaged a Victorian-era boathouse situated at the River Avon close by, inadvertently demonstrating the weapon's power. It is built on the design of a similar trebuchet at Middelaldercentret in Denmark. In 1989, Middelaldercentret became the first place in the modern era to have a working trebuchet.
Hejaz<SEP>Blue glazes were first developed by ancient Mesopotamians to imitate lapis lazuli, which was a highly prized stone. Later, a cobalt blue glaze became popular in Islamic pottery during the Abbasid Caliphate, during which time the cobalt was mined near Kashan, Oman, and Northern <ENT>Hejaz<ENT> .

Ripley<SEP>Gould was born in Lyme Regis the first son of a gardener. He and the boy probably had a scanty education. Shortly afterwards his father obtained a position on an estate near Guildford, Surrey, and then in 1818 Gould became foreman in the Royal Gardens of Windsor. He was for some time under the care of J. T. Aiton, of the Royal Gardens of Windsor. The young Gould started training as a gardener, being employed under his father at Windsor from 1818 to 1824, and he was subsequently a gardener at <ENT>Ripley<ENT> in Yorkshire. He became an expert in the art of taxidermy.  In 1824 he set himself up in business in London as a taxidermist, and his skill helped him to become the first Curator and Preserver at the museum of the Zoological Society of London in 1827.
Norton<SEP>In October 1993 the 105th returned to Somalia, delivering military personnel and almost 860,000 pounds of equipment non-stop—with triple air refueling—directly from bases in the United States to Mogadishu. In July 1994 105th aircraft began carrying humanitarian relief supplies to the people of Rwanda—by early September 1,635,189 pounds of supplies and equipment were delivered to East Africa. In late September 1994 the unit began airlifting over a million pounds of supplies and equipment to Haiti as part of Operation Uphold Democracy. The 105th played a key role in July 1995 for Operation Quick Lift when it airlifted 431,000 pounds of cargo and 190 British troops from <ENT>Norton<ENT> , UK to Split Croatia in support of the United Nations' Rapid Reaction Deployment Force.
Wembley<SEP>Football is the most popular of these sports. The England national football team, whose home venue is <ENT>Wembley<ENT> , played Scotland in the first ever international football match in 1872. Referred to as the "home of football" by FIFA, England hosted the 1966 FIFA World Cup, and won the tournament by defeating West Germany 4–2 in the final, with Geoff Hurst scoring a hat-trick. With a British television audience peak of 32.30 million viewers, the final is the most watched television event ever in the UK.
Portland<SEP>The village has a main shopping street with several shops. The nearby villages of Chiswell and Castletown almost merge into Fortuneswell, as they share the limited space on the northern slopes of the island. However, Fortuneswell occupies the steepest land far above sea level, whereas Castletown and Chiswell occupy flat land close to sea level, next to <ENT>Portland<ENT> and Chesil Beach respectively.
Ramstein<SEP>18 AF was inactivated effective 1 January 1958 due to budgetary reasons, and its units were reassigned to Twelfth Air Force (which had been reassigned from U.S. Air Forces Europe at <ENT>Ramstein<ENT> , West Germany to James Connally AFB).

Vancouver<SEP>St. Mary's was founded by twelve sisters from the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary in 1859, at the request of archbishop François Norbert Blanchet. Only two of the sisters spoke English; the others spoke French. They traveled from Montreal via ship and rail to <ENT>Vancouver<ENT> where Blanchet had established a school on property he purchased from Daniel H. Lownsdale in 1857. The property had a two-story house, which became the school. St. Mary's opened in the same location with six female students (three Catholic, two Jewish, one Protestant) on Monday, November 7, 1859, 17 days after they reached Portland.
Rugby<SEP>Sir John Holbrook Osborn (14 December 1922 – 2 December 2015) was a British Conservative Party politician. He was educated at <ENT>Rugby<ENT> and Trinity Hall, Cambridge.

He was knighted in the 1983 Birthday Honours.
Carnarvon<SEP>Wilson was brought up in Dundee. He joined the Metropolitan Police as a Constable in 1946 and joined Special Branch, in which he was to spend over twenty years, in 1948. Promoted Detective Chief Superintendent in 1968, he was in charge of security for the Investiture of the Prince of Wales at <ENT>Carnarvon<ENT> in 1969, which was threatened by Welsh nationalists. In 1969 he was promoted to Commander and took command of Special Branch. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1969 Birthday Honours.
Hilton<SEP>South Hylton was originally known as Hylton Ferry or Low Ford, its current name not coming into regular use until the late 18th to early 19th century. It originally formed part of the Manor of Ford owned by the Barons Hylton, until the estates of <ENT>Hilton<ENT> were sold off in 1750 after the death of the last baron. Originally a collection of farmsteads, it became a diversified industrial village as a result of the Industrial Revolution.
Ramstein<SEP>The 417th resumed service when it activated on 1 October 1978 at Zweibrücken Air Base, West Germany, as part of the 26th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing. At that time, however, the squadron only received a few people and one F-4D Phantom II aircraft. The unit moved to <ENT>Ramstein<ENT> , West Germany on 1 November 1978, but evidently lost its personnel and aircraft to become a paper organization. Moreover, the 417th also transferred from the 26th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing to the 86th Tactical Fighter Wing on 15 November 1981, remaining a paper organization until it inactivated on 15 September 1987.
Vancouver<SEP>While working for the HBC out of <ENT>Vancouver<ENT> , he received permission to settle some land on the French Prairie in 1831. However, Laframboise stayed with the company and helped restore the health of Hall J. Kelley when he arrived at the fort in 1834 with Ewing Young. Young’s party had been attacked on their way through Southern Oregon in the Rogue River Valley by the Rogue River Indians. These Native Americans were retaliating against whites after an expedition led by Laframboise killed eleven Natives earlier that year. This series of killings lasted for decades and eventually led to the Rogue River Wars in the 1850s. Meanwhile, Laframboise continued to lead expeditions south, occasionally independent of the HBC.
Times Square<SEP>As part of the redevelopment of <ENT>Times Square<ENT> , a new 20-foot-wide (6.1 m) entrance with a glass canopy will be built. A new elevator to the building's observation deck will be installed and maintained by Jamestown Developers. The entrance will replace the exit to 43rd Street and will lead to the west side of Broadway between 42nd Street and 43rd Street, as well as a previously closed exit to the northeastern corner of 42nd Street and 7th Avenue. The space currently used by passengers heading to and from the 43rd Street exit or to and from trains on Track 4 will be placed outside of fare control for this new entrance. The portion of the existing station to the west of this new control area will no longer be accessible to passengers. To the west of the end of the platform on Track 4, a wall decorated by artwork will be installed, blocking the view of the connection between Track 4 and the Broadway-Seventh Avenue Line.
Salamanca<SEP>Alonso's father, also called Alonso Tostado, was a ploughman. The nickname Tostado  refers to a ploughman's tanned or sunburnt complexion. After a course of grammar under the Franciscans he entered <ENT>Salamanca<ENT> , where, besides philosophy and theology, he studied civil and canon law, Greek, Hebrew, and the other branches then comprised in the curriculum of a university. By great application joined to an unusually brilliant mind and an extraordinarily retentive memory, he accumulated such a vast store of knowledge that his contemporaries styled him a wonder of the world. At 22 he began to lecture on a wide variety of subjects to large audiences attracted by his learning.
Salisbury<SEP>On 24 November 2018, as the finale of the Bernstein in Chichester celebrations to mark the centenary of Bernstein's birth, the choirs of Chichester Cathedral, Winchester Cathedral and <ENT>Salisbury<ENT> again joined forces to sing Chichester Psalms in Chichester Cathedral. They were accompanied by the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra conducted by Marin Alsop, a former pupil of Bernstein. The treble solo was sung by the Chichester Head Chorister, Jago Brazier. Alexander Bernstein, Bernstein's son, was in the audience, as he had been in 1965.
Salt Lake<SEP>From 1921 to 1938, Richards was the president of <ENT>Salt Lake<ENT> . In this capacity, he assisted in the changing of the temple ordinances to conform with the church's "Good Neighbor" policy. During his time as temple president the modern methods and uses of the temple were largely instituted. Baptisms for health and ordinations of the sick were discontinued in the temple, and endowment sessions starting at night were begun.
San Siro<SEP>Osvaldo opened the 2012–13 season with a goal against Catania in a 2–2 draw. On 2 September 2012, he scored his second goal of the season against Internazionale in a match that saw Roma win 1–3 against the Nerazzurri at <ENT>San Siro<ENT> . He scored his third league goal, a penalty, against Juventus in a 4–1 defeat at Juventus Stadium. He scored a brace in a 4–2 win over Genoa and scored his sixth goal of the season in a 4–1 win against Palermo on 4 November. He also scored a goal against former club Fiorentina for a 4–2 win for Roma.

West Edmonton<SEP>6teen is an animated sitcom for older children, preteens, and teenagers. The plots take place almost entirely in a gigantic shopping mall known as the Galleria mall. The Galleria mall is a cross between the Toronto Eaton Centre and <ENT>West Edmonton<ENT> . The series follows the cast of six 16 year-old friends in everyday lives, including their first part-time jobs.
Berkeley<SEP>For many years, the story of the Bisley Boy tempted people into believing that Queen Elizabeth I of England was really a man. According to the legend, Elizabeth (then a princess) had died aged 10 while staying at <ENT>Berkeley<ENT> , Gloucestershire. Her minders, terrified of the retribution of her father, Henry VIII, made a substitution. A lookalike boy from the nearby village of Bisley was put in her place and sworn to secrecy. This legend "explained" why Elizabeth never married or had children. Proponents of the "Bisley Boy" story included Bram Stoker in his 1910 nonfiction book Famous Impostors.
Covent Garden<SEP>In March 1991, a cover of U2's "Where the Streets Have No Name" as a medley with "Can't Take My Eyes Off You", the 1960s pop song by Frankie Valli/The Four Seasons, was released as a double A-sided single with a remix of the album track "How Can You Expect to Be Taken Seriously?" by Brothers in Rhythm. This was followed by the duo's first world tour. Named Performance, the tour kicked off in Tokyo, on 11 March 1991. The tour also visited the United States, Canada, France, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. The shows were designed by David Alden and David Fielding, who had designed several sets for <ENT>Covent Garden<ENT> .
Ramstein<SEP>On 1 April 1994, the unit was reactivated and reassigned to U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE)) and NATO and stationed at Aviano Air Base, Italy, absorbing the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and equipment of the inactivated 526th Fighter Squadron, which had been inactivated at <ENT>Ramstein<ENT> , Germany when the 86 FW became an airlift wing (86 AW) following the inactivation of the 435th Airlift Wing and the downsizing of its former installation, Rhein-Main Air Base, Germany. At Aviano, the squadron returned to its previous mission as an operational combat fighter squadron.
Habbaniya<SEP>By October 1941 the regiment was on its way to join Middle East Forces. On arrival it was sent to Persia and Iraq Force (Paiforce) in Iraq, where General Henry Maitland Wilson was trying to build up the AA resources of Tenth Army to meet a possible German advance on the vital oilfields via the Caucasus. This was a slow process: by June 1942, 83rd (Blythswood) HAA Rgt was still the only HAA unit in Tenth Army. By the end of the year it formed part of 8 AA Bde in Tenth Army. The tasks undertaken were the defence of the Basra base area, <ENT>Habbaniya<ENT> , Baghdad, Mosul and the oil installations at Kirkuk. Each of these gun defence areas received one HAA battery.
Parkes<SEP>The equator was crossed for the first time in the program  when it switched to the Australian contributions, which was at 5:22 a.m. Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST). This was the most technically complicated point in the broadcast, as both the Japanese and Australian satellite ground stations had to reverse their actions: Tokyo had to go from transmit mode to receive mode, while Melbourne had to switch from receive to transmit mode. The first segment dealt with trams leaving the South Melbourne tram depot with Australian Broadcasting Commission's Brian King explaining that sunrise was many hours away as it was winter there. Two scientific segments, later on in the broadcast, were also included; one, presented from Canberra by the ABC's Eric Hunter showed experiments being carried out by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) to extend the frequency of cereal crop cycles, while the second dealt with <ENT>Parkes<ENT> tracking a deep space object.
Carnarvon<SEP>In early 1967 he became Minister of State for Commonwealth Affairs. As Secretary of State for Wales from 1968 to 1970 he presided over the investiture of the Prince of Wales at <ENT>Carnarvon<ENT> in 1969. Thomas was fervently attached to the Royal Family and also strongly opposed to Plaid Cymru and particularly to the Welsh Language Society.
Gallipoli<SEP>Australia–United Kingdom relations are close, marked by shared history, culture, institutions and language, extensive people-to-people links, aligned security interests, and vibrant trade and investment cooperation. The long-standing relationship formally began in 1901 when the six British Crown colonies in Australia federated, and the Commonwealth of Australia was formed as a Dominion of the British Empire. Australia fought alongside Britain in World War I, notably at <ENT>Gallipoli<ENT> , and again in World War II.  Andrew Fisher, Australian prime minister from 1914 to 1916, declared that Australia would defend the United Kingdom "to the last man and the last shilling." Until 1949, the United Kingdom and Australia shared a common nationality code.  The final constitutional ties between United Kingdom and Australia ended in 1986 with the passing of the Australia Act 1986. Currently, more than 4% of the Australian population was born in the UK, giving strong mutual relations. Furthermore, investment and trade between the two countries are still important.
Arecibo<SEP>In 2012, on the 35th anniversary of the Wow! signal, <ENT>Arecibo<ENT> beamed a digital stream toward the area of the signal's origin. The transmission consisted of approximately 10,000 Twitter messages solicited for the purpose by the National Geographic Channel, bearing the hashtag "#ChasingUFOs" (a promotion for one of the channel's TV series). The sponsor also included a series of video vignettes featuring verbal messages from various celebrities.
Jax<SEP>The Navy purchased the airplanes using standard commercial practices, ordering six of the 737-700C models. The first two of four aircraft were delivered on 21 April 2001 to Fleet Logistics Support Squadron Five Nine (VR-59) at the Naval Air Station/Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, Texas, with two more aircraft following before the end of the year. The fifth and sixth aircraft were delivered in August 2002 to VR-58 at <ENT>Jax<ENT> , Florida. Further aircraft have been delivered to VR-57 at the Naval Air Station North Island, California. The C-40A provides superior fuel efficiency, range and payload compared to the C-9B aircraft it placed.
Salisbury<SEP>Edmund as depicted on the west front of <ENT>Salisbury<ENT> .
Glastonbury<SEP>The original pre-Norman church was recorded in the 12th-century Book of Llandaff to have been no more than 28 feet (8.5 m) long, 15 feet (4.6 m) wide and 20 feet (6.1 m) high. It contained low, narrow aisles with an apsidal porticus measuring 12 feet (3.7 m) long. Construction began of a grander building under the orders of the second Norman bishop of Llandaff, Urban, in the 1120s, to administer power over the newly formed diocese. It doesn't appear to have lasted long as an extensive construction was ordered between 1193 and 1218 during the episcopate of Henry of Abergavenny. The western parts replaced those that Urban had built, and the nave and front of this side remain today. The fine craftsmanship and subtlety of the architecture show a clear similarity to those of <ENT>Glastonbury<ENT> and Wells Cathedral, so it is probable that several of the leading craftsman of Somerset were hired for the building.
Elsinore<SEP>By the time Prins Christian Frederik reached Denmark, epidemic typhus had broken out among her crew. Ice in the Danish harbours prevented her from docking, and crew were replaced over the ice. On 17 March morale deteriorated further when news arrived that King Christian had died. She was ordered into the Great Belt (Storebælt) strait to provide cover for a crossing of a French army corps consisting of Spanish soldiers ordered by Jean Baptiste Jules Bernadotte (later King of Sweden) to attack Skåne. Having been alerted to the Danish plan, the British ships give chase. The British ships intended to outmanoeuvre, corner, and overpower Prins Christian Frederik; Captain Carl Jessen, after conferring with his officers, decided to take a stand in order to gain enough of a tactical advantage to move into familiar waters and within the protective range of the cannon at <ENT>Elsinore<ENT> .
Orly<SEP>A company called Airports of Paris manages all of the civilian airports in the Paris Region, including Charles de Gaulle Airport, Le Bourget Airport and <ENT>Orly<ENT> .  it also manages a number of overseas airports, particularly in the Middle East, including the airports of Tripoli, Zagreb, Amman, Algiers and Islamabad.   The company has 9,500 employees in the Paris Region.  Its headquarters is located at 291 boulevard Raspail, in the 14th arrondissement.
NYC<SEP>Certain markets support commercial shuttles. The pioneer service was the Rio de Janeiro-São Paulo air bridge in Brazil which began 5 July 1959. Other early services include the Eastern Air Shuttle, inaugurated in 1961, which offered no-frills, hourly flights connecting <ENT>NYC<ENT> in New York City with Washington National Airport and Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts.
Misawa<SEP>Cole founded a Creative Management Company that has booked various Reality TV stars and artists to participate in worldwide military tours with Armed Forces Entertainment (Asia, South Pacific, Europe and Diego Garcia). He has worked with celebrities from Survivor, The Amazing Race, American Idol, So You Think You Can Dance and Big Brother. Cole, who is also a musician/composer/songwriter, served as Tour Manager for a multi-city concert tour of Japan, in 2011, which featured an All-Star cast from various seasons of American Idol. The concerts were put on to help boost morale and entertain U.S. military troops and families stationed overseas. He even helped arrange a private show for the children of <ENT>Misawa<ENT> in Japan, the closest base to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami disaster epicenter, that same year.
San Siro<SEP>Czechoslovakia did not qualify for the 1978 FIFA World Cup, as Scotland won their group. The country did qualify for Euro 1980, and by coming second in its group behind West Germany faced the hosts Italy in a third-place play-off, which it won on sudden-death penalties at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples. At the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain, Czechoslovakia was eliminated in the group stage after draws with Kuwait and France and losing 2–0 to England. The country's last ever major tournament was the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy, where in the group it opened with a 5–1 win over the United States before defeating Austria with a Michal Bilek penalty, enough to advance despite losing 2–0 to the hosts at the Stadio Olimpico. In the last 16 at the Stadio San Nicola in Bari, a hat-trick from Tomáš Skuhravý featured in a 4–1 in over Costa Rica. Czechoslovakia was eliminated on 1 July in a quarter-final at <ENT>San Siro<ENT> , losing 1–0 from a Lothar Matthäus penalty against eventual winners West Germany.

Stirling<SEP>As part of the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, where single-battalion regiments were linked together to share a single depot and recruiting district in the United Kingdom, the 72nd was linked with the 91st (Argyllshire Highlanders) Regiment of Foot, and assigned to district no. 58 at <ENT>Stirling<ENT> . On 1 July 1881 the Childers Reforms came into effect and the regiment amalgamated with the 78th (Highlanders) Regiment to form the 1st Battalion of the Seaforth Highlanders.
Warwick<SEP>For his refusal to comply with the rubrics he was suspended by William Laud, and would have emigrated to America had he not been dissuaded by John Dod, on whose recommendation he was appointed chaplain to Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke at <ENT>Warwick<ENT> . During his residence there he married a Coventry lady. The mother of John Maynard persuaded Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford to obtain for him the vicarage of St Eustachius' Church, Tavistock in Devon, and the earl also made him his chaplain.
Wotton<SEP>On 16 May 1749, Wyndham married George Grenville, then a Lord of the Treasury and an MP for Buckingham. Her grandfather, the Duke of Somerset, did not approve of the marriage and left Wyndham only a small amount of money in his will.

Rapti<SEP>Shravasti, the north-eastern town of Uttar Pradesh, is located near <ENT>Rapti<ENT> . This town is closely associated with the life of Gautama Buddha, who is believed to have spent 24 Chaturmases here. Age-old stupas, majestic viharas and several temples near the village of "Sahet-Mahet" establish Buddha's association with Shravasti. According to Nagarjuna, the city had a population of 900,000 in 5th century BCE and it even overshadowed Magadha's capital, Rajgir.
South Bank<SEP>After signing for Young Turks, Koreless was featured in a label showcase on BBC Radio 1 broadcast live at Maida Vale Studios in London with a live string quartet.

Fort Recovery<SEP>Tensions cooled between Wayne and the Kentuckians over the winter of 1793–94. Wayne noticed that, despite their obstinance, the Kentucky volunteers appeared to be good soldiers. The militiamen, after observing Wayne, concluded that he – unlike Harmar and St. Clair – knew how to combat the Indians. Wayne augmented his popularity in Kentucky by building <ENT>Fort Recovery<ENT> over the winter on the site of St. Clair's defeat. The Indians' victory over St. Clair had become a part of their lore and inspired them to continue the fight against the western settlers; Wayne's construction of a fort on this site was a blow to the Indian psyche, and his re-burial of some 600 skulls that the Indians had dug up and scattered across the area was popular with Kentuckians, since many of their own were among the dead. While Scott came to respect Wayne personally, his friend, James Wilkinson, began an anonymous campaign to tarnish Wayne's image, coveting command of the Northwest expedition for himself. Scott, on leave in Philadelphia at the time, wrote to Secretary of War Henry Knox to defend Wayne's reputation, breaching his friendship with Wilkinson.
West Edmonton<SEP>For comparison, the largest mall in Canada, <ENT>West Edmonton<ENT> in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada has a retail space of 350,000 m².

Hejaz<SEP>The Thamūd (/θæˈmuːd/; Arabic: ثمود‎) is an ancient civilization in <ENT>Hejaz<ENT> known from the 8th century BCE to near the time of Muhammad. The Thamud civilization was located in the north of the peninsula. Although they are thought to have originated in Southern Arabia, Arabic tradition has them moving north to settle on the slopes of Mount Athlab near Mada'in Saleh.
Wells<SEP>Just before the Norman Conquest, Milverton was granted by Edith of Wessex to Bishop Gisa of <ENT>Wells<ENT> , but this was reversed by William the Conqueror. The manor was then united with Torrington in Devon passing in 1212 to William Briwere. The parish was part of the Milverton Hundred,
Chantilly<SEP>Sarafina did not race as a two-year-old and made her debut in a maiden race over 1600 metres at <ENT>Chantilly<ENT> on 3 May 2010. Starting the 6/4 favourite she took the lead 200 metres from the finish and pulled clear of her seventeen opponents to win in "impressive" style by six lengths. Three weeks later the filly was stepped up sharply in class for the Group 1 Prix Saint-Alary over 2000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in which she was partnered by Gerald Mosse. She was made the 13/8 favourite ahead of eight rivals including Deluxe (unbeaten in two starts), Dariole (Prix Penelope) and Hibaayeb. After racing in fifth place she accelerated in the straight and overcame a rough passage to take the lead in the closing stages and won "comfortably" by half a length from Deluxe. The racecourse stewards held an inquiry into possible interference caused by the winner but left the result unchanged. Alain de Royer-Dupre commented "It wasn’t a great interference and she really walked all over them. She’s a very good filly, but still has a lot to learn".
Warwick<SEP>About 1490, Francis Bryan was born in Buckinghamshire, England. He was the son of Sir Thomas Bryan and Margaret Bourchier, and came to court at a young age. There he became, along with his brother-in-law Nicholas Carew, one of "the King's minions", a group of young gentlemen of the Privy chamber who held much sway with Henry and were known for their intemperate behaviour. He was rewarded for his friendship with the king by a number of public offices, such as master of the toils (1518-48), constable of the castles of Hertford (1518-34), Harlech (1521-death) and Wallingford (1536). He was also joint constable of <ENT>Warwick<ENT> from 1528-death, cipherer of the Household (1520), gentleman of the privy chamber (by 1521) and Esquire of the Body by 1522.
Cassino<SEP>Reformers attached great importance to the elevation and translation of saints, moving their bodies from their initial resting place to a higher and more prominent location to make them more accessible for veneration. An important precursor was the seventh-century translation of the remains of St Benedict himself from <ENT>Cassino<ENT> to Fleury Abbey. By the tenth century, translation usually involved a grand procession, an elaborate new shrine and often reconstruction of the church. Almost nothing is known of the life of Swithun, who was an obscure ninth-century Bishop of Winchester until Æthelwold launched a major cult of him as a saint, and translated his grave from outside the Old Minster to a new shrine inside. After Æthelwold's own death in 984 his progress to becoming the subject of a cult followed the conventional path: his grave is said to have been neglected until he appeared in a vision to say that his body should be moved, and his successor Ælfheah then built a new choir to hold his body, where it became the focus of miracles.
Darlington<SEP>Kahne has six career starts in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, winning five of them; his lone non-victory is a second-place run at Pocono Raceway in 2010. In 2004, he made a pair of starts in the series at <ENT>Darlington<ENT> and Homestead-Miami Speedway, driving the No. 2 Team ASE Racing Dodge Ram for Ultra Motorsports, winning both races. At the 2015 Charlotte Truck race, he held off Erik Jones for the win by .005 seconds, the second-closest margin in Truck Series history.

Trafford<SEP>Amy Hughes (born 1987) is a British marathon runner. In 2014-15, Hughes claimed to have completed 53 marathons in 53 days, after which she claimed to have broken the Guinness World Record. However, her record claim was rejected by the organisation, as their requirements at the time asked for claimants to have run the marathons in official races. In 2017, Hughes claims to have broken the 7 day treadmill world record, by running 521 miles (838 km) over seven days at <ENT>Trafford<ENT> . Her record claim was rejected as implausible for a non-elite runner, and it also lacked independent verification.

All of this was accomplished throughout the 1976 season.
Abu Ghraib<SEP>Donald E. Pease mocks American exceptionalism as a "state fantasy" and a "myth" in his 2009 book The New American Exceptionalism. Pease notes that "state fantasies cannot altogether conceal the inconsistencies they mask", showing how such events as the revelations of prisoner abuse at <ENT>Abu Ghraib<ENT> and the exposure of government incompetence after Hurricane Katrina "opened fissures in the myth of exceptionalism".

The aircraft are being maintained by GJD Systems to a fully airworthy condition.
Tortuga<SEP>The Florida Reef is the only living coral barrier reef in the continental United States. It is also the third largest coral barrier reef system in the world, after the Great Barrier Reef and the Belize Barrier Reef. The reef lies a little bit off of the coast of the Florida Keys. A lot of the reef lies within John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, which was the first underwater park in the United States. The park contains a lot of tropical vegetation, marine life, and seabirds. The Florida Reef extends into other parks and sanctuaries as well including <ENT>Tortuga<ENT> , Biscayne National Park, and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Almost 1,400 species of marine plants and animals, including more than 40 species of stony corals and 500 species of fish, live on the Florida Reef. The Florida Reef, being a delicate ecosystem like other coral reefs, faces many threats including overfishing, plastics in the ocean, coral bleaching, rising sea levels, and changes in sea surface temperature.
Rock Island<SEP>Savanna Army Depot was a 13,062-acre (52.86 km) installation, located on the eastern bank of the Mississippi River, in Carroll and Jo Daviess counties, around seven miles (11 km) north of Savanna, Illinois. It was opened in 1917 as a proving and testing facility for weapons developed at <ENT>Rock Island<ENT> . In 1921 it became a weapons depot. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) listed the depot as a Superfund site in 1989. The depot was selected for closure through the Base Realignment and Closure process in July 1995 and was officially closed on March 18, 2000. The Jo-Carroll Local Redevelopment Authority (LRA) was established to redevelop a portion of the property for commercial and business usage referred to as the Savanna Depot Park. On September 26, 2003, the United States Department of Defense agreed to transfer 9,404 acres (38.06 km) of land to become the Lost Mound Unit of the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge. 3,022 acres (12.23 km) were initially transferred with the rest to be transferred following environmental cleanup. The portion near Lock and Dam No. 12 was transferred to the United States Army Corps of Engineers and a small part to the Illinois Department of Natural Resources.
Edmonton<SEP>On April 29, 2011, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority completed a deal with Triple Five Group, the owners of two of North America's largest malls: <ENT>Edmonton<ENT> and the Mall of America, who had previously proposed "MeadowFest America" for the New Jersey site in 2002, before the contract was awarded to Mills Corporation. Triple Five assumed ownership of the mall and renamed it "American Dream Meadowlands", with an opening date of early 2014, to coincide with Super Bowl XLVIII at MetLife Stadium, just across the highway. The deal was officially announced on May 3, 2011. Among the changes to the project would an expansion to 3 million square feet, an 8.5-acre indoor glass-domed amusement park, water parks, and an ice skating rink. The ski slope would also carry over from previous iterations of the project. In July 2012 DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg indicated that the amusement park would incorporate attractions based on that studio's properties, such as Shrek and Madagascar. By May 2013, progress on the project was delayed further by financing, permitting, and a lawsuit filed by the New York Giants and New York Jets over traffic concerns. Triple Five officially took ownership of the mall on July 31, 2013, with construction set to start in late August of that year, despite the lawsuit. Construction officially began in November and the developer estimated it would take approximately 24 months to complete the project.

Ascot<SEP>After the 1972 release of Deep Throat, Linda Lovelace enjoyed a brief flurry of celebrity notoriety while dating David Winters of West Side Story fame, which included appearances at the Academy Awards ceremony with Winters and the opening day of the racing season at <ENT>Ascot<ENT> plus author credit for two best-selling books that played up on her status as a pornographic icon.  By 1974, however, her career stalled.  An R-rated sequel to her breakthrough film, Deep Throat Part II, was commercially unsuccessful, and her attempts to establish success as a nightclub singer and stage actress were considered failures.  The film Linda Lovelace for President was designed by David Winters to establish the star’s crossover appeal with mainstream moviegoers. Winters came up with the idea for the film after observing the strong positive reaction that college students exhibited towards Linda Lovelace during her speeches at various college campuses.

Kudryavtsev started his geological career in 1920 at the USSR Geological Committee. In 1929-1971 he worked for All-Union Geological Research Institute (VNIGRI). He suffered from political repressions during Joseph Stalin's regime for his unorthodox thinking, spending several years in Gulag camps in the Transpolar European Russia as an "enemy of the people". After that, he was prohibited from living or staying in central cities of USSR. His only son died defending <ENT>Brest<ENT> in the beginning of Nazi aggression against USSR.
Oak Ridge nuclear facility<SEP>During World War II he was employed as a chemist for the Manhattan Project, working at Clinton Laboratories (now <ENT>Oak Ridge nuclear facility<ENT> ) from 1944 to 1946. In 1945, together with Lawrence E. Glendenin and Charles D. Coryell, he isolated the previously undocumented rare earth element 61. Marinsky and Glendenin produced promethium both by extraction from fission products and by bombarding neodymium with neutrons. They isolated it using ion-exchange chromatography. Publication of the finding was delayed until later due to the war. Marinsky and Glendenin announced the discovery at a meeting of the American Chemical Society in September 1947. Upon the suggestion of Coryell's wife, the team named the new element for the mythical Prometheus, who stole fire from the gods and was punished for the act by Zeus. They had also considered naming it "clintonium" for the facility where it was isolated.
Misawa<SEP>The wing was deployed to <ENT>Misawa<ENT> , Japan between 13 August and 7 November 1953 to support SAC's rotational deployment of fighter units to northern Japan to perform air defense duties, relieving the 12th Strategic Fighter Wing.

Upon the wing's return to the United States, the 506th was re-equipped with new F-84F Thunderstreaks, in January 1954 becoming the first SAC fighter wing to be equipped with the swept-wing Thunderjet model.  The wing remained at Dow for just over a year until being reassigned to Second Air Force and was transferred to Tinker AFB, Oklahoma on 20 March 1955.
Tredegar<SEP>The Petersburg Railroad saw much action and destruction during at the end of the American Civil War. During the Civil War, the Petersburg Railroad carried food and equipment to General (CSA) Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia The Petersburg Railroad carried supplies south and sometimes carried U.S. prisoners of war.  The railroad requisitioned supplies from <ENT>Tredegar<ENT> during the war.  Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant severed these rails as part of the effort to cut supply lines to Petersburg for the Siege of Petersburg.The rails were damaged in the Battle of Globe Tavern, the Battle of Jerusalem Plank Road and Second Battle of Ream's Station. Since the Petersburg Railroad was the road to Weldon, North Carolina the first two are sometimes referred to as the Battles for the Weldon Railroad.
Covent Garden<SEP>More recently The Forum, a multi-use arts and community centre, has staged a number of theatre productions and concerts. Having been built and run by Hambleton District Council, the Forum was taken over by a new registered charity in August 2012. Since mid 2011, with support from Cine Yorkshire, a project run by the National Media Museum, the Forum has been host to the latest digital cinema projection equipment and is showing mainstream films on a weekly basis - as well as live broadcasts from National Theatre Live and <ENT>Covent Garden<ENT> 
Molesworth<SEP>In September 1944 Wight-Boycott was posted as a headquarters staff officer with No. 12 Group RAF but only a few months later moved to an appointment as station commander of RAF Church Fenton. In early 1945 he moved, again as station commander, to <ENT>Molesworth<ENT> , home of the USAF 303rd Bombardment Group, and remained there until September, when he attended a "Methods of Instruction" course at the RAF Senior Staff College.
Portland<SEP>Grafton was launched by Lady Grantham, wife of Admiral Sir Guy Grantham, who was Commander-in-Chief Portsmouth. She was first commissioned in January 1957, serving with the 2nd Frigate Squadron based at <ENT>Portland<ENT> until March 1963, when the ship started a refit at Portsmouth Dockyard. Following this refit, Grafton joined the 20th Frigate Squadron based at Londonderry Port in Northern Ireland, being based there until April 1969, when she was paid off.
Vancouver<SEP>As early as the 1820s, native workers from the Hawaiian Islands (called the "Sandwich Islands" at the time), were employed in the kitchen and other skilled trades by the Hudson's Bay Company at <ENT>Vancouver<ENT> , mostly living south and west of the main palisade in an area known as "Kanaka Village." Kanakas, employed in agriculture and ranching, were present in the mainland United States as early as 1834, primarily in California under Spanish colonial rule, and later under American company contracts. (Richard Henry Dana refers often to Kanaka workers and sailors on the Californian coast in his book Two Years Before the Mast).
Rugby<SEP>He was educated at <ENT>Rugby<ENT> and briefly studied Law at University of Oxford.  In 1940 he joined the Fleet Air Arm.  He flew the Supermarine Seafire in operations in North Africa, the Mediterranean and in the south of France.  He rose to the rank of Lt Commander and was awarded the DSC and the MBE.
Williamsburg<SEP>Largely thanks to the vision of a William and Mary instructor, Reverend Dr. W. A. R. Goodwin, the College Building, the President's House and the Brafferton (originally the Indian School) were restored to their 18th-century appearance between 1928 and 1932 with substantial financial support from John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and his wife, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller. Together, they led the establishment and beginnings of <ENT>Williamsburg<ENT> .
Ely<SEP>Panels have been toured in traveling exhibitions including a North American tour in 1993/1994. An exhibition of 39 panels in <ENT>Ely<ENT> in 2012 attracted 11,273 visitors during its 27-day stay.
Dachau<SEP>Adolf Maislinger (December 9, 1903, Munich – April 26, 1985, Munich) was a member of the German Resistance and was a survivor of <ENT>Dachau<ENT> .
Dalkeith<SEP>The nursery's clients included the Duke of Northumberland (who held nearby Syon House); the Clitherow family at Boston Manor; the Duke of Devonshire at Chiswick House; Robert Child at Osterley Park; and, further afield, the Duke of Buccleuch at <ENT>Dalkeith<ENT> in Scotland. Capability Brown also purchased plants from the nursery.
Lahore<SEP>The Naulakha Pavilion at <ENT>Lahore<ENT> in Pakistan displays the distinct Bengali Do-chala style roof.
Darlington<SEP>In 2004, Kenny Wallace returned to MWR in the No. 00. Running four races for the team, his best finish was a 22nd at Homestead-Miami Speedway. Wallace ran two races in 2005, finishing 27th at <ENT>Darlington<ENT> . Johnny Benson ran a pair of races that season as well, but did not finish any higher than 42nd. David Reutimann, who drove for Waltrip's brother Darrell in the Craftsman Truck Series, made his Cup debut at Lowe's Motor Speedway that season, qualifying 26th and finishing 22nd. In 2006, the No. 00 ran under two separate entries. The first ran with listed owners Mike and Bonnie Anderson under the name MBA Racing. It campaigned Ford Fusions with Hermie Sadler driving. He made only three starts, with his best finish 40th at the Daytona 500. The other was the MWR car with Waltrip as the listed owner. Bill Elliott drove the Monte Carlo in five races in 2006 with a sponsorship from Burger King.
Oak Ridge<SEP>In 1961, NASA's Space Nuclear Propulsion Office[1], in conjunction with the Atomic Energy Commission, jointly awarded Aerojet General Corporation the prime contract for its Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application NERVA Program, with a significant subcontract to WANL for development of the reactor itself. With the award, WANL selected the Large site as the base for operations and moved its personnel to the facility. Originally authorized in May 1959, WANL officially became a Westinghouse division on July 26, 1959 under the leadership of John Wistar Simpson. Cornell University physicist Sidney Krasik served as the first technical director and Frank Cotter was the first marketing director. Born in 1914, Simpson graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1937 and earned an MS from the University of Pittsburgh in 1941. Working in the switchgear division of Westinghouse's East Pittsburgh plant, Simpson helped develop the electric switchboards that could survive the extreme impacts experienced by naval vessels in the Pacific Theater during World War II. In 1946, he took a leave of absence to work at <ENT>Oak Ridge<ENT> to familiarize himself with atomic power. Upon his return, he became assistant manager in the engineering department of the Westinghouse Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory. He subsequently managed the construction of the Shippingport Atomic Power Station in 1954, the first commercial nuclear power plant in the United States. Promoted the next year to general manager of the Bettis Laboratory, he was elected a Westinghouse vice president in 1958 and by 1959 was eager to take on the new challenge of developing nuclear rocket engines to enable the exploration of the solar system.
Hedingham<SEP>It was originally the home of John de Vere (c.1558 – 1624), eldest brother of Horace and Francis. They were members of a junior branch of the de Vere family and their first cousin was Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, the owner of <ENT>Hedingham<ENT> . In the 18th century it was the residence of Peter Muilman, a Dutch merchant, antiquary and father of the MP and antiquary Trench Chiswell. A view of the house features on a medal Muilman had struck to commemorate his fortieth wedding anniversary. It was Grade II listed on 7 August 1952 and is now a significant local farmhouse.
Wembley<SEP>Stevenage F.C. have played at the Lamex Stadium since 1980. Stevenage was the first club to win a competitive match at the <ENT>Wembley<ENT> , beating Kidderminster Harriers 2-3 in the 2007 FA Trophy Final. The club currently play in the EFL League Two and have been managed by former player Dino Maamria since March 2018.
Winchester<SEP>Joseph was educated at <ENT>Winchester<ENT> and at Oriel College, Oxford, and followed his father into the church, becoming curate of Winslade in 1748. In 1754, he was instituted as rector at The Church of All Saints, Tunworth. In his early days Joseph wrote poetry, of which the most notable piece is The Enthusiast (1744), an early precursor of Romanticism. In 1755, he returned to his old school to teach, and from 1766 to 1793 was its headmaster, but it was a role in which he did not distinguish himself.  His career as a critic was always more illustrious, and he produced editions of classical poets such as Virgil as well as English poets including John Dryden.  Like his brother, he was a friend of Samuel Johnson, and formed part of the literary coterie centered on the publisher Robert Dodsley.
Stockport<SEP>Dominating the western approaches to the town is <ENT>Stockport<ENT> . Built in 1840, the viaduct's 27 brick arches carry the mainline railways from Manchester to Birmingham and London over the River Mersey. This structure featured as the background in many paintings by L. S. Lowry.
Williamsburg<SEP>The North American open-air museum, more commonly called a living-history museum, had a different, slightly later origin than the European, and the visitor experience is different. The first was Henry Ford's Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Michigan (1928), where Ford intended his collection to be “a pocket edition of America”. <ENT>Williamsburg<ENT> (opened in 1934), though, had a greater influence on museum development in North America. It influenced such projects through the continent as Mystic Seaport, Plimoth Plantation, and Fortress Louisbourg. The approach to interpretation tends to differentiate the North American from the European model. In Europe, the tendency is to usually focus on the buildings.
Mackinac<SEP>Cheboygan was originally an Ojibwe settlement. In 1844, Jacob Sammons, a cooper from <ENT>Mackinac<ENT> , chose the old native camping ground (then called "Shabwegan") as the site for his cabin. He recruited other settlers, and a post office named "Duncan" was established in 1846. It was made the county seat in 1853.
Harrogate<SEP>Winksley does not have a railway station, but the nearest railway stations are <ENT>Harrogate<ENT> which is 10.46 miles away and Starbeck which is 10.64 miles away.
Ampleforth<SEP>Although St Martin's serves as the College's main feeder school it is independently managed; the College's governing body is chaired by the abbot of <ENT>Ampleforth<ENT> while St Martin's is managed as a charity trust and chaired by a lay member.
Uppsala<SEP>Anders Gustav Ekeberg was a Swedish scientist, mathematician and expert in Greek literature. He was a gifted student and enrolled at <ENT>Uppsala<ENT> 1784, graduating in 1788. He was made docent in chemistry 1794 and experimentator (laborator) 1799. In 1799, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Carl Gustaf Ekeberg was his uncle.
Brookwood<SEP>Following his wife's death he went to live with his nephew at Ashley, Filsham Drive, Pebsham near Bexhill-on-Sea in Sussex and died there on 7 February 1961. He is buried with his wife beside his parents in <ENT>Brookwood<ENT> .
Oak Ridge<SEP>In 1953, Robert W. Bussard, a physicist working on the Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft (NEPA) project at <ENT>Oak Ridge<ENT> wrote a detailed study. He had read Cleaver and Shepard's work, that of Tsien, and a February 1952 report by engineers at Consolidated Vultee. He used data and analyses from existing chemical rockets, along with specifications for existing components. His calculations were based on the state of the art of nuclear reactors. Most importantly, the paper surveyed several ranges and payload sizes; Consolidated's pessimistic conclusions had partly been the result of considering only a narrow range of possibilities.
Misawa<SEP>In the aftermath of this event, the 21st was relocated to <ENT>Misawa<ENT> where it conducted a reduced schedule of training while both the airfield and its damaged aircraft were repaired.  A ceremony marking the 21st’s return to Matsushima was held on March 28, 2016.
Little Falls<SEP>Until the construction of <ENT>Little Falls<ENT> , there was a water power mill at the mouth of the Little Elk River.
Solovki<SEP>Bolshoy Solovetsky Island (Russian: Большой Соловецкий остров), or simply Solovetsky Island (Russian: Соловецкий остров) is the biggest island of the Solovetsky Islands archipelago in the White Sea, northern Russia. The island is home to <ENT>Solovki<ENT> , a medieval monastery and a fortress included in the World Heritage list.
Cartmel<SEP>The founder, Walter FitzEdward de Salisbury, was the son of Edward de Salisbury, a High Sheriff of Wiltshire; he gave lands for a priory as a daughter house of St. Mary's Abbey, Cirencester, according to its charter, "to serve God forever!". After the death of his wife, he "took the tonsure and habit of the canons" and on his death in 1147, was buried in the Priory, near the choir. His descendants, the Earls of Salisbury remained closely connected with the priory for many years. In 1190 thirteen of the canons migrated to form the first community of <ENT>Cartmel<ENT> , now in Cumbria, which had been recently founded by William Marshal, Earl of Pembroke.
Wells<SEP>Often built on the foundations of older Norman churches, the Perpendicular Gothic-style Somerset towers became landmarks for travelers, with their square, corner-buttressed towers typically positioned on the west side of the churches. The towers soar more than 100 feet (30 m) in some cases – 182 feet (55 m) in the case of <ENT>Wells<ENT> 's north tower (1440). Most of the towers house bells, and bell-ringing became a tradition still practiced in some of these English country churches. Most of the churches in this article have been designated, under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, by English Heritage as grade I listed buildings, which is defined as encompassing those "of outstanding or national architectural or historic interest". Those that do not achieve grade I are listed as II*, which means "particularly significant buildings of more than local interest."
Salisbury<SEP>Henry was the youngest of William and Matilda's four sons. Physically he resembled his older brothers Robert Curthose, Richard and William Rufus, being, as historian David Carpenter describes, "short, stocky and barrel-chested," with black hair. As a result of their age differences and Richard's early death, Henry would have probably seen relatively little of his older brothers. He probably knew his sister Adela well, as the two were close in age. There is little documentary evidence for his early years; historians Warren Hollister and Kathleen Thompson suggest he was brought up predominantly in England, while Judith Green argues he was initially brought up in the Duchy. He was probably educated by the Church, possibly by Bishop Osmund, the King's chancellor, at <ENT>Salisbury<ENT> ; it is uncertain if this indicated an intent by his parents for Henry to become a member of the clergy. It is also uncertain how far Henry's education extended, but he was probably able to read Latin and had some background in the liberal arts. He was given military training by an instructor called Robert Achard, and Henry was knighted by his father on 24 May 1086.
Watertown<SEP>In 1919, the Westervelt Board described the ideal heavy gun for future development having a bore of 194mm to 8-inches, a projectile of about 200 lbs, and a range of 35,000 yards. More striking was that it be must be road transportable. At this time no other country had such a road-transportable field gun. Low-priority design work occurred until 1924.  Serious development began in June 1940 of an  8-inch (203 mm) gun that would have a range of 33,500 yards (30,600 m), a road speed of 25 mph (40 km/h), be transported in two loads weighing no more than 44,000 lb (20,000 kg) and be suitable for rail movement. The gun used the same projectile as the 8-inch coastal gun and the US Navy's 8-inch cruiser gun.  Using the same carriage as the 240 mm howitzer M1 eased development, but the gun was very troublesome and was not standardized until January 1942. The main problems were excessive bore wear and poor accuracy, but it was felt that nothing better could be produced in a timely manner. Thus it entered production at a low rate and in small numbers. The gun tube was produced by Watervliet Arsenal, and the recoil system was produced by Hannifin Manufacturing. <ENT>Watertown<ENT> , Bucyrus-Erie, and the S. Morgan Smith Company manufactured the carriage.  Only 139 weapon systems were produced before production ceased in 1945.
Wotton<SEP>George Grenville was born at <ENT>Wotton<ENT> on 14 October 1712. He was the second son of Richard Grenville and Hester Temple (later the 1st Countess Temple). He was one of five brothers, all of whom became MPs. His sister Hester Grenville married the leading political figure William Pitt. His elder brother was Richard Grenville, later the 2nd Earl Temple. It was intended by his parents that George Grenville should become a lawyer. Grenville received his education at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford, and was called to the bar in 1736.
Jax<SEP>The state became a major hub for the United States Armed Forces. Naval Air Station Pensacola was originally established as a naval station in 1826 and became the first American naval aviation facility in 1917. The entire nation mobilized for World War II and many bases were established in Florida, including <ENT>Jax<ENT> , Naval Station Mayport, Naval Air Station Cecil Field, Naval Air Station Whiting Field and Homestead Air Force Base.
Gallipoli<SEP>The 1/4th Battalion landed at Suvla Bay as part of the 160th Brigade in the 53rd (Welsh) Division in August 1915; it was evacuated from <ENT>Gallipoli<ENT> and moved to France for service on the Western Front in May 1918. The 1/5th (Cinque Ports) Battalion landed in France as Army Troops attached to the Home Counties Division in early 1915, seeing action at the Battle of Aubers Ridge in May 1915 and then moved to Italy in November 1917.
Uppsala<SEP>Born in Gothenburg, Anger studied law at Stockholm University and later at <ENT>Uppsala<ENT> . After graduating in November 1939, he was drafted into the Army. Soon afterwards, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs offered him a trainee position at the Swedish legation in Berlin, which he began in January 1940. Anger was assigned to the trade department, but after the legation received information about an impending Nazi attack on Norway and Denmark, he became involved in relaying intelligence to Stockholm. In June 1941, he returned to Stockholm, where he worked on trade relations between Sweden and Hungary. In November 1942, he was sent to Budapest as Second Secretary at the Swedish legation.
Penang<SEP>In 1985, <ENT>Penang<ENT> that connects Gelugor with the Malay Peninsula was completed. The bridge has indirectly boosted urbanisation at Gelugor, which also lies right between George Town proper and the Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone.
Winchester<SEP>Buckle was the son of George Buckle, canon of Wells Cathedral, and Mary Hamlyn Earle, the sister of the philologist John Earle. He attended Honition grammar school and <ENT>Winchester<ENT> before beginning studies at New College, Oxford in 1873. There he won the Newdigate Prize in 1875 and received a first class in both literae humaniores and modern history. From 1877 until 1885, he was a Fellow of All Souls College.
Rock Island<SEP>In 1968, the Army Small Arms Program developed plans for a new 5.56 mm caliber LMG, though no funds were allocated (5.56 mm ammunition was viewed as underpowered by many in the armed forces). Studies of improved 5.56 mm ammunition, with better performance characteristics, began. The earliest reference to studies of other caliber cartridges for the LMG did not appear until 1969. In July 1970, the U.S. Army finally approved development of an LMG, with no specified caliber. At this time, the nomenclature "Squad Automatic Weapon" (SAW) was introduced. Actual design of alternative cartridges for the LMG did not begin until July 1971. A month later, Frankford Arsenal decided on two cartridge designs for the new LMG: a 6 mm cartridge and a new 5.56 mm cartridge with a much larger case. Neither design was finalized by March 1972, when the Army published the specifications document for the planned SAW. The 6 mm cartridge design was eventually approved in May that year. Prior to July 1972, SAW development contracts were awarded to Maremont, Philco Ford, and the Rodman Laboratory at <ENT>Rock Island<ENT> . These companies produced designs with Army designations XM233, XM234 and XM235 respectively—X denoting "experimental". Designs were required to have a weight of less than 9.07 kg (20 lb) including 200 rounds of ammunition, and a range of at least 800 meters (2,600 ft).
Hays<SEP>Rowland joined the Army Air Corps at <ENT>Hays<ENT> , Columbus, Ohio in January 1938. He was assigned to flying school  Randolph Field, Texas, and graduated from pursuit course at Kelly Field, Texas, Feb. 1, 1939. He was assigned to the 94th Pursuit Squadron, 1st Pursuit Group, Selfridge Field, Michigan then transferred to the 16th Pursuit Group, Albrook Field, Panama Canal Zone.
Chantilly<SEP>With the outstanding French colt Sea-Bird engaged in The Derby Reliance started the 1/2 favourite for the Prix du Jockey Club over 2400m at <ENT>Chantilly<ENT> in June. Reliance won by three-quarters of a length from Diatome, a colt who went on to win the Washington, D.C. International Stakes later that year, with Carvin third. Three weeks later, Reliance moved up in distance for the Grand Prix de Paris over 3000m at Longchamp. He started the 11/10 favourite and won by a length, with Diatome again taking second.
Rugby<SEP>Stallworthy was born in London.  His parents, Sir John Stallworthy and Margaret Stallworthy, were from New Zealand and moved to England in 1934. Stallworthy started writing poems when he was only seven years old. He was educated at the Dragon School, <ENT>Rugby<ENT> and at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he won the Newdigate prize. His work include seven volumes of poetry, and biographies of Wilfred Owen and Louis MacNeice. He has edited several anthologies and is particularly known for his work on war poetry.
San Siro<SEP>Scoring nine goals in 44 appearances attracted the attention of Ligue 1 side Lille and before long he was a starter in the first team. Famous for his technique and pace, the Nigerian player was being monitored by a number of prestigious European clubs. Odemwingie indicated that he wanted to stay at Lille and help them fight for the league the following season and scored five league goals for them in the 2006–07 season as well as two against A.C. Milan at <ENT>San Siro<ENT> to take Lille to the UEFA Champions League knockout stages.
Berkeley<SEP>A war breaking out with France in this year, he was sent over to that kingdom, as general of the infantry: all the officers for this expedition were selected, they being "all right hardie and valiant knights, esquires, and gentlemen". This force, which amounted to 6,000 men, having crossed the sea, marched out of Calais, to join the Emperor Charles V on 22 July in an attempt to retake Landrecies, which had lately been wrested from that monarch by the French. King Francis I of France, anxious to save the place, appeared before it; and the allies, with the Emperor at their head, as boldly opposed them; but, when both parties thought a battle inevitable, and the allies had drawn out their army, the French King took that opportunity to relieve the garrison and having resupplied the place with men, ammunition, and provisions; and marched away. The allies, to revenge themselves, attacked the Dauphin who was left with the rearguard; but, being too eager, they fell into an ambuscade, and many of the English were taken prisoners: amongst them were Sir George Carew, Sir Thomas Palmer, and Sir Edward Bellingham. However, the English amply retorted upon the French, killing and taking great numbers prisoner. Mark Noble was of the opinion, that the English forces behaved themselves with great gallantry during their short stay in France; which was only until November in the same year. In the account of this expedition history does not record the particular achievements of individuals that composed the army but Noble speculates that Sir Richard behaved with his usual good conduct; especially as, in the following year 1544, Henry appointed him constable of <ENT>Berkeley<ENT> .
Nauen<SEP>At the start of the war, Germany expanded its unofficial propaganda machinery, establishing the Central Office for Foreign Services, which among other duties was tasked with propaganda distribution to neutral nations, persuading them to either side with Germany or to maintain their stance of neutrality. After the declaration of war, Britain immediately cut the undersea telegraph cables that connected Germany to the outside world, thereby cutting off a major propaganda outlet. The Germans relied instead on the powerful <ENT>Nauen<ENT> to broadcast pro-German news reports to the world. Among other techniques used to keep up the morale of the troops, mobile cinemas were regularly dispatched to the front line for the entertainment of the troops. Newsreels would portray current events with a pro-German slant. German propaganda techniques heavily relied on emphasising the mythological and martial nature of the Germanic 'Volk' and the inevitability of its triumph.
Cassino<SEP>He was known for his ascetic life, his virtues, and theological learning. For a time he lived as a hermit, but his reputation drew followers to Rossano, whom he began to instruct. However, after a while, he realized that he was viewed as a local authority, and hearing that there was talk of making him bishop, Nilus fled to Capua, where he stayed for fifteen years. Later he spent certain periods of his life at various monasteries which he either founded or restored. Although Nilus instructed his monks according to the Rule of St. Basil, he maintained cordial relations with the Benedictines at <ENT>Cassino<ENT> , where he spent some time, as well as at the Alexius monastery in Rome. The Rule of St. Basil was one of the resources Benedict had recourse to when drafting his own rule.
Oak Ridge atomic plant<SEP>A fusion reactor concept called the Bumpy torus made use of a series of magnetic mirrors joined in a ring. It was investigated at <ENT>Oak Ridge atomic plant<ENT> until 1986.
Auschwitz<SEP>In January 1945, Soviet and allied Polish armies undertook a massive offensive, aiming at the liberation of Poland and the defeat of Nazi Germany. Marshal Ivan Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front broke out of its Sandomierz Vistula bridgehead on 11 January and rapidly moved west, taking Radom, Częstochowa and Kielce on 16 January. Kraków was liberated on 18 January, a day after Hans Frank and the German administration fled the city. Marshal Konev's forces then advanced toward Upper Silesia, freeing the remaining survivors of <ENT>Auschwitz<ENT> on 27 January. In early February, the 1st Ukrainian Front reached the Oder River in the vicinity of Breslau.
Orly<SEP>Turkish Airlines Flight 981 was a scheduled flight from Istanbul Yesilköy Airport to London Heathrow Airport, with an intermediate stop at <ENT>Orly<ENT> in Paris. On 3 March 1974, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 operating the flight crashed into the Ermenonville Forest, outside Paris, killing all 346 people on board. The crash was also known as the Ermenonville air disaster. At the time, Flight 981 was the deadliest plane crash in aviation history until 27 March 1977, when 583 people perished in the collision of two Boeing 747s in Tenerife. It remained the deadliest single-aircraft accident until the crash of Japan Airlines flight 123 on 12 August 1985, and the deadliest aviation accident without survivors until the Charkhi Dadri mid-air collision on 12 November 1996. It remains the deadliest single-aircraft accident without survivors.
Sudbury<SEP>During World War II, its predecessor unit, the 486th Bombardment Group (Heavy) was an Eighth Air Force heavy bombardment unit in England, stationed at <ENT>Sudbury<ENT> . The group operated chiefly against strategic objectives in Germany until May 1945, flying 188 missions and losing 33 aircraft.
Bayonne<SEP>On June 16 at about 14:30 local time, Alva Cape was moving westward through Kill Van Kull with a cargo of 4,200,000 US gallons (16,000,000 l) of naphtha, inbound from India. Texaco Massachusetts was outbound in ballast, bound for Port Arthur, Texas, and was turning into the channel from Newark Bay when she collided with Alva Cape on the latter ship's starboard side at the west end of Kill Van Kull, just west of <ENT>Bayonne<ENT> . At the time of the collision, Texaco Massachusetts was being aided by the tugboat Latin American, while Alva Cape had the tug Esso Vermont alongside.
Chantilly<SEP>At <ENT>Chantilly<ENT> on 1 October, Happily was matched against male opposition in the Group 1 Prix Jean-Luc Lagardere over 1600 metres. Ridden by Moore she went off the 6/5 favourite ahead of five rivals including Masar (Solario Stakes), Olmedo (runner-up in the Prix des Chenes) and the Listed race winners Mythical Magic and Francesco Bere. She raced towards the rear of the field as Mythical Magic set the pace before moving upon the outside in the straight. The filly gained the advantage inside the last 100 metres and wone by one and a quarter lengths and a short neck from Olmedo and Masar. Ryan Moore said "We were confident she would get the trip well. We started racing a long way from home and she showed a great will to win. For a filly to beat the colts is a good thing for the future".
Ely<SEP>His principal writings are An Essay on Miracles (1701); Chronicum preciosum (an account of the English coinage, 1707); and Free Sermons  (1712), containing discourses on the death of Queen Mary, the Duke of Gloucester and King William. The preface to this last was condemned to public burning by Parliament, but, as No. 384 of The Spectator,  circulated more widely than ever. A collected edition of his works, with a biographical preface, was published in 1737. His memorial by monumental masons Edward Stanton (sculptor) and C. Horsnaile is in the north chancel aisle of <ENT>Ely<ENT> .
Rock Island<SEP>Norman Foster Ramsey Jr. was born in Washington, D.C., on August 27, 1915, to Minna Bauer Ramsey, an instructor at the University of Kansas, and Norman Foster Ramsey, a 1905 graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point and an officer in the Ordnance Department who rose to the rank of brigadier general during World War II, commanding <ENT>Rock Island<ENT> . He was raised as an Army brat, frequently moving from post to post, and lived in France for a time when his father was Liaison Officer with the Direction d'Artillerie and Assistant Military Attaché. This allowed him to skip a couple of grades along the way, so that he graduated from Leavenworth High School in Leavenworth, Kansas, at the age of 15.
Edmonton<SEP>On April 29, 2011, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority completed a deal with Triple Five Group, the owners of two of North America's largest malls: <ENT>Edmonton<ENT> and the Mall of America, who had previously proposed "MeadowFest America" for the New Jersey site in 2002, before the contract was awarded to Mills Corporation. Triple Five assumed ownership of the mall and renamed it "American Dream Meadowlands", with an opening date of early 2014, to coincide with Super Bowl XLVIII at MetLife Stadium, just across the highway. The deal was officially announced on May 3, 2011. Among the changes to the project would an expansion to 3 million square feet, an 8.5-acre indoor glass-domed amusement park, water parks, and an ice skating rink. The ski slope would also carry over from previous iterations of the project. In July 2012 DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg indicated that the amusement park would incorporate attractions based on that studio's properties, such as Shrek and Madagascar. By May 2013, progress on the project was delayed further by financing, permitting, and a lawsuit filed by the New York Giants and New York Jets over traffic concerns. Triple Five officially took ownership of the mall on July 31, 2013, with construction set to start in late August of that year, despite the lawsuit. Construction officially began in November and the developer estimated it would take approximately 24 months to complete the project.
Misawa<SEP>The port has seven fuel terminals with capacity to store over 11 million barrels of oil, and supplies fuel for the local fishing fleet as well as nearby <ENT>Misawa<ENT> operated by the United States Air Force.
Ramstein<SEP>The 510th was reactivated at Aviano Air Base, Italy on 1 July 1994 as the 510th Fighter Squadron.  The squadron was equipped with General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcons made available from the 512th Fighter Squadron at <ENT>Ramstein<ENT> , Germany, which was inactivating as the 86th Fighter Wing became an airlift unit.  The 510th, during Operation Deliberate Force, the 1995 NATO intervention in Bosnia, was the first F-16 Block 40 squadron to drop a laser-guided bomb.  It also made the first combat use of night vision goggles in an F-16 during Operation Deliberate Guard, a follow up operation.  It was also one of the first F-16 units to become Forward Air Controllers (Airborne), and were the first controllers to employ the F-16 in combat.
Cardiff City<SEP>With the exception of a short period this century, the team have played in home colours of blue and white since 1908, which gives them the nickname "The Bluebirds". Cardiff's first permanent ground was Ninian Park opened in 1910; it remained in use for 99 years until the club moved into <ENT>Cardiff City<ENT> in 2009. Cardiff have long-standing rivalries with nearby clubs Swansea City, known as the South Wales derby and Bristol City, known as the Severnside derby. The club's record appearance holder is Billy Hardy, who made 590 appearances in a 20-year playing spell with Cardiff, and their record goalscorer is Len Davies with 179 goals.
Uppsala<SEP>University-level education in Örebro started in the 1960s, when <ENT>Uppsala<ENT> started to offer some courses in Örebro. On the basis of these activities, an independent högskola (university college) was created in 1977 under the name Högskolan i Örebro (Örebro University College). This university college also incorporated three other existing educational institutions in Örebro: the teaching seminar, the sports college (founded in 1966) and the social work college (founded 1967). Örebro University College was granted the privileges of a university by the Government of Sweden in 1999, becoming the 12th university in Sweden.
Gard<SEP>Roman arch bridges were usually semicircular, although a few were segmental (such as Alconétar Bridge). A segmental arch is an arch that is less than a semicircle. The advantages of the segmental arch bridge were that it allowed great amounts of flood water to pass under it, which would prevent the bridge from being swept away during floods and the bridge itself could be more lightweight. Generally, Roman bridges featured wedge-shaped primary arch stones (voussoirs) of the same in size and shape. The Romans built both single spans and lengthy multiple arch aqueducts, such as <ENT>Gard<ENT> and Segovia Aqueduct. Their bridges featured from an early time onwards flood openings in the piers, e.g. in the Pons Fabricius in Rome (62 BC), one of the world's oldest major bridges still standing. Roman engineers were the first and until the industrial revolution the only ones to construct bridges with concrete, which they called opus caementicium. The outside was usually covered with brick or ashlar, as in the Alcántara bridge.
Salisbury<SEP>The play was presented at Shakespeare's Globe, directed by James Dacre, as part of the summer season 2015 in the 800th anniversary year of Magna Carta. A co-production with Royal & Derngate, this production also played in <ENT>Salisbury<ENT> , Temple Church and The Holy Sepulchre, Northampton.
Southampton<SEP>In 1966 he became an unusually young professor when he took the chair at the newly founded Department of Archaeology at <ENT>Southampton<ENT> . There he became involved in the excavation (1961–68) of the Fishbourne Roman Palace in Sussex. Another site in southern England led him away from the Roman period. He began a long series of summer excavations (1969–88) of the Iron Age hill fort at Danebury, Hampshire and was subsequently involved in the Danebury Environs Programme (1989–95). His interest in Iron Age Britain and Europe generated a number of publications and he became an acknowledged authority on the Celts.
San Siro<SEP>Džeko started his third season at the Roman club with six goals in first five league games. He scored his first goal of the season against Internazionale on 26 August 2017, which Roma lost 1–3. In the next two games, he scored two braces, against Verona and Benevento. He continued his goalscoring form by opening the score against Milan on 1 October, in a 2–0 win away at <ENT>San Siro<ENT> .
Hejaz<SEP>Under the Fatimids, Egypt became the centre of an empire that included at its peak parts of North Africa, Sicily, Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the Red Sea coast of Africa, Tihamah, <ENT>Hejaz<ENT> , Yemen, with its most remote territorial reach being Multan (in modern-day Pakistan). Egypt flourished, and the Fatimids developed an extensive trade network both in the Mediterranean and in the Indian Ocean. Their trade and diplomatic ties, extending all the way to China under the Song Dynasty (r. 960–1279),  eventually determined the economic course of Egypt during the High Middle Ages. The Fatimid focus on agriculture further increased their riches and allowed the dynasty and the Egyptians to flourish under the Fatimid rule. The use of cash crops and the propagation of the flax trade allowed Fatimids to import other items from various parts of the world.
Lowell<SEP>The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989; it was included in the bounds of <ENT>Lowell<ENT> in 1978.
West Edmonton<SEP>The use of flash mobs performing round dances in shopping malls became a recurring theme of the protest during the pre- and post-Christmas shopping season in 2012. On December 17 a flash mob performed a round dance at the Cornwall Centre shopping mall in Regina.  The following day a similar flash mob round dance occurred at <ENT>West Edmonton<ENT> . This tactic was also used at the Rideau Centre in Ottawa and St. Vital Centre in Winnipeg. It spread internationally with a similar protest at the Mall of America in Minnesota. Members of the Sandy Bay First Nation in Manitoba blocked the Trans-Canada Highway on December 15, 2012. Members of the Driftpile First Nation also blocked a road on December 18.
Glastonbury<SEP>Baldwin also collaborated with Bartholomew Iscanus on a Liber penitentialis, which is jointly ascribed to both of them in a Lambeth Palace manuscript, MS 235. Another work often attributed to Baldwin, the Ad laudem Bartholomaei Exoniensis episcopi de coloribus rhetoricis, survives in three manuscripts and a fragment of a fourth. A number of other works are known to have been authored by Baldwin, but do not survive. These include Carmen devotionis, which was seen by John Bale at <ENT>Glastonbury<ENT> in the 16th century. Other lost works were a commentary on the biblical books of Samuel and Kings, De sectis haereticis which existed at Christ Church Priory in the 13th century, and De orthodoxis fidei dogmatibus, which was seen by John Leland at Christ Church in the 16th century. Some of Baldwin's letters existed in manuscript form, although they appear never to have circulated as a collection, but they are no longer extant. One of his letters is mentioned in a Rievaulx Abbey catalogue, and Leland mentions others in his works.
San Siro<SEP>Under coach Marcello Lippi, Šimić had his Serie A debut in a 2–0 win against Venezia at <ENT>San Siro<ENT> on 10 January 1999. By the end of his first season in Italy, Šimić earned a total of 17 appearances and scored 2 goals for Internazionale. In the following couple of seasons Šimić's services were regularly used, until the 2001–02 season, when he had only 12 league and 8 European appearances. After Héctor Cúper was appointed for coach in 2001, Šimić fell out of favour with the new manager and in June 2002 Internazionale and their cross-city rivals AC Milan agreed a player swap with Ümit Davala going in the opposite direction, which Šimić was valued €16.5 million, despite it was purely accounting purpose. In his three and a half years with Internazionale he earned a total of 66 league appearances and scored 3 goals. The club failed to win any silverware in this period, and their highest finish was fourth place in the 1999–2000 season, even though this was the time when some of football's biggest stars played there with Šimić, such as Roberto Baggio, Ronaldo, Ivan Zamorano, Diego Simeone and Christian Vieri.
Charing Cross<SEP>Denmark Street is a street on the edge of London's West End running from <ENT>Charing Cross<ENT> to St Giles High Street. It is near St Giles in the Fields Church and Tottenham Court Road station. The street was developed in the late 17th century and named after Prince George of Denmark. Since the 1950s it has been associated with British popular music, first via publishers and later by recording studios and music shops. A blue plaque was unveiled in 2014 commemorating the street's importance to the music industry.
Salisbury<SEP>The major breakthrough in this period was in the manufacture of glass, with the first cast plate glass being developed in France. Iron was increasingly employed in structures. Christopher Wren used iron hangers to suspend floor beams at Hampton Court Palace, and iron rods to repair <ENT>Salisbury<ENT> and strengthen the dome of St Paul's Cathedral. Most buildings had stone ashlar surfaces covering rubble cores, held together with lime mortar. Experiments were made mixing lime with other materials to provide a hydraulic mortar, but there was still no equivalent of the Roman concrete. In England, France and the Dutch Republic, cut and gauged brickwork was used to provide detailed and ornate facades. The triangulated roof truss was introduced to England and used by Inigo Jones and Christopher Wren.
Oak Ridge<SEP>Another meter of note is the Kearny fallout meter.  The plans for this meter were published in Appendix C of Nuclear War Survival Skills by Cresson Kearny from research performed at <ENT>Oak Ridge<ENT> .   It was designed to be able to be constructed from household materials by someone with moderate mechanical ability on the eve of an attack.  The plans are presented in a newspaper printable format.
Ascot<SEP>In an uncanny parallel to the career of his sire Montjeu, Hurricane Run's campaign as a four-year-old began brightly, but then tailed off somewhat towards the end of the season. After winning the Tattersalls Gold Cup at The Curragh, he suffered lost the June 25, 2006, Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud in Paris. He returned to action on 29 July, ridden by Belgian jockey Christophe Soumillon, to win the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at <ENT>Ascot<ENT> . His season ended with runs in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and Champion Stakes and, finally, the Breeders' Cup Turf.
Souda<SEP>The United States and Greece have long-standing historical, political, and cultural ties based on the shared democratic values, history of Greek immigration to the States and participation as Allies during World War II, the Korean War, and the Cold War. Previously, the US helped the reconstruction of post-war Greece through the Marshall plan and various other aids culminating at about $11.1 billion in economic and security assistance since 1946. The current mutual defense cooperation agreement (MDCA) provides for continued U.S. military assistance to Greece and the operation by the U.S. of a military facility at <ENT>Souda<ENT> , Crete.
Iron Bridge<SEP>The Barton Aqueduct of 1761, and subsequent canal aqueducts in the United Kingdom, used large quantities of masonry and puddling to obtain watertightness. After the success <ENT>Iron Bridge<ENT> in 1789, however, cast iron was used by Telford on aqueducts such as Chirk and Pontcysyllte. Aqueducts built in the early part of the 19th century use either puddle clay or an iron trough in no particular pattern. The Almond Aqueduct uses an iron trough to achieve watertightness, as well as containing the outward pressure of the water, allowing it to be of more slender construction than a purely stone aqueduct such as the Kelvin Aqueduct.
Ohio<SEP>Albert obtained his degree from <ENT>Ohio<ENT> where he played both hockey and lacrosse. He played goalie for both sports. Albert was invited to training camp by the New York Rangers and ended up playing a single season for the Toledo Blades.
Plymouth<SEP>Morrissey was born in Hartford, Connecticut. Growing up in Connecticut and Massachusetts, he started playing guitar at age 13 and formed a jug band in high school. He studied literature for a short time at <ENT>Plymouth<ENT> before beginning his musical career.
Winchester<SEP>An example of a retroquire is within <ENT>Winchester<ENT> which was built between 1200 and 1230 to house a shrine for Saint Swithun.
Auchinleck<SEP>James Boswell of <ENT>Auchinleck<ENT> , the famous biographer and friend of Dr. Samuel Johnson was married in 1769 to his cousin, the youngest daughter of David, Margaret Montgomerie in Lainshaw Castle. He had gone to Ireland with Margaret, with the intention of courting another wealthy cousin, however he fell in love with the penniless Margaret and married her instead. The room they were married in was one floor above the room in which the Earl of Eglinton was laid after he was murdered by Cunninghame at the old brig or ford on the Annick Water near the entrance to the castle on the Stewarton road.
Norfolk<SEP>The ship was named for World War II Pacific fleet commander Chester W. Nimitz, USN, (1885–1966), who was the Navy’s third fleet admiral. Nimitz had her homeport at <ENT>Norfolk<ENT> until 1987, when she was relocated to Naval Station Bremerton in Washington (now part of Naval Base Kitsap). Following her Refueling and Complex Overhaul in 2001, her home port was changed to Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego County, California. The home port of Nimitz was again moved to Naval Station Everett in Washington in 2012.
Stirling<SEP>With the arrival of the English king the attack on Berwick began in earnest. Seton carried out a spirited defence; but by the end of June, under repeated attack by land and sea, his troops were close to exhaustion. He requested and was granted a short truce, but only on the condition that he surrender if not relieved by 11 July. As a guarantee of good faith Seton was required to hand over a number of hostages, which included his son, Thomas. Scotland was now faced with exactly the same situation that England had before Bannockburn: as a matter of national pride Douglas would have to come to the relief of Berwick, just as Edward II had come to the relief of <ENT>Stirling<ENT> in 1314. The army the Guardian had spent so much time gathering was now compelled to take to the field, with all initiative lost. Nevertheless, Douglas' force was an impressive representation of the nation's strength and unity, with volunteers coming from all corners of the realm. As with all medieval armies the precise number of troops is difficult to estimate. It is possible, though, that the army was at least as strong as that which had fought at Bannockburn, perhaps even stronger. Douglas now began his belated march to the border.
Incheon<SEP>Rhee holds a Bachelor of Science, Master of Engineering, Doctorate of Construction Management at Chung-Ang University, Korea. He is a professional architectural engineer and a construction management specialist. His occupation titles include Senior Director at Hanmi Global Co., Ltd., concurrent Professor at Chung-Ang University in Seoul, Korea. He was Project Manager for Hanjin Heavy Industries (formerly Korea Shipbuilding and Engineering Corporation) in Korea and Hong Kong (1976–1990), General Manager of Architectural Marketing Team and Project Manager for various international construction sites including the Pebble Bay Condominiun and Pulau Seraya Power Station in Singapore, as well as <ENT>Incheon<ENT> for Samsung C&T Corporation (1990–2008). He is presently Vice President of Construction Management Marketing Department at Hanmi Parsons Corporation. Rhee currently resides in Seoul, Korea, is married, and has two daughters.
Watts<SEP>Harold in the Land of Jazz (also released as Grooveyard) is the debut album by saxophonist Harold Land recorded in 1958 and released on the Contemporary label. Land's band on the album included jazz pianist Carl Perkins (not to be confused with the American Rockabilly singer and songwriter of the same name) in one of his final appearances on record. Perkins died two months after the recording session. The original LP cover showed Land playing his saxophone in front of <ENT>Watts<ENT> , which at the time had been condemned by the City of Los Angeles and were in danger of being destroyed.
Brookwood<SEP>Dudley Hardy died of heart failure in 1922, and was buried at <ENT>Brookwood<ENT> near Woking in Surrey.
Portland<SEP>The fortress was built in 1900-02 as a coastal defence overlooking Lyme Bay to defend <ENT>Portland<ENT> and the other naval institutions on the island. The fort was operational during both World Wars with two 9.2 inch guns. During World War 2, on the night of the 27 April 1944, the fort witnessed the Slapton Sands Massacre. As part of Exercise Tiger, United States soldiers were practicing landings at Slapton Sands when they were attacked by German E-Boats. The gunners at Blacknor Fort were ordered not to open fire for fear of hitting the Allied troops. More than 600 American soldiers and seamen drowned by the end of the night, many were pulled down by the weight of their own equipment.
Farnham<SEP>Mbeki met Thabo Mbeki while studying at the University of London and they were married in a registry office in London on 23 November 1974, followed by a religious ceremony at the home of her older sister Edith, <ENT>Farnham<ENT> in Surrey. He had to receive permission from the ANC to marry and reportedly told Adelaide Tambo "if Papa [Oliver Tambo] doesn't allow me to marry Zanele, I'll never, ever marry again. And I'll never ask again. I love only one person and there is only one person I want to make my life with, and that is Zanele." The couple have no children and have often lived apart.
Hejaz<SEP>At the same time (effectively from 8 March), the Ottoman command changed. The highest level Ottoman headquarters in Palestine was the Yıldırım Army Group. The Army Group had originally been formed to recapture Baghdad which had been captured by the British in March 1917. Instead, it had been diverted to Palestine where the British were close to capturing Jerusalem. The Army Group's commander was the German General Erich von Falkenhayn, who wished to continue a policy of "yielding defence" rather than hold positions at all costs. He was also prepared to retreat to shorten his lines of communication and reduce the need for static garrisons. However, he was unpopular among Ottoman officers, mainly because he relied almost exclusively on German rather than Turkish staff officers, and was blamed for the defeats at Gaza and Jerusalem. He was replaced by another German General, Otto Liman von Sanders, who had commanded the Ottoman defence during the Gallipoli Campaign. Liman reasoned that continued retreat in Palestine would demoralise the troops, ruin their draught animals, encourage the Arab Revolt to spread further north into the Ottoman rear areas and also lead to all the Ottoman forces to the south in <ENT>Hejaz<ENT> being finally isolated. His forces halted their retreat and dug in to resist the British, even reoccupying some ground near the Jordan as Allenby's two raids across the Jordan were repulsed.
Harewood<SEP>In 2006 and 2007 the two-day Wireless Festival took place at <ENT>Harewood<ENT> . Leeds band Kaiser Chiefs headlined the festival in 2007.
Penshurst<SEP>The series went into production in March 2008, with filming in Wales and France (at the Château de Pierrefonds). Two Kent locations were also used: The Barons Hall and Garden Tower at <ENT>Penshurst<ENT> , and Chislehurst Caves for the first series. The series was produced by Shine in association with BBC Wales, whose Head of Drama Julie Gardner was executive producer for the BBC. Doctor Who's chief writer Russell T Davies had been an important influence on the tone and style of Merlin. CGI special effects for the series were provided by The Mill. The Old English for spells was written by university scholar and medievalist Dr. Mark Faulkner, and later by the script editing team. An initial series of 13 episodes, Merlin began transmission in the UK on 20 September 2008. A trailer was prepared in advance for television, cinemas, and online.
NYC<SEP>Brooklyn's water borders are extensive and varied, including Jamaica Bay; the Atlantic Ocean; The Narrows, separating Brooklyn from the borough of Staten Island in New York City and crossed by the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge; Upper New York Bay, separating Brooklyn from Jersey City and Bayonne in the U.S. state of New Jersey; and the East River, separating Brooklyn from the borough of Manhattan in New York City and traversed by the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, the Brooklyn Bridge, the Manhattan Bridge, the Williamsburg Bridge, and numerous routes of the New York City Subway. To the east of Brooklyn lies the borough of Queens, which contains <ENT>NYC<ENT> in that borough's Jamaica neighborhood, approximately two miles from the border of Brooklyn's East New York neighborhood.
Deptford<SEP>HMS Rochester was a 50-gun fourth rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, built at <ENT>Deptford<ENT> and launched on 3 August 1749.
Gallipoli<SEP>The British 39th Infantry Brigade was first formed as part of the 13th (Western) Division in World War I, and was with the Division in <ENT>Gallipoli<ENT> , Mesopotamia, and Persia for the entire war. The brigade was detached from the division on 1 July 1918 and posted to North Persia Force where it remained until 31 August 1919.
Brookwood<SEP>MacLeod died at 87 Victoria Street in London on 29 April 1920 and was buried at <ENT>Brookwood<ENT> .
Misawa<SEP>Because the 35th garnered the majority of its history in the Pacific theater during World War II, and in California since 1971 until its move to Iceland, it was decided to relocate the unit back to that area. Consequently, the 35th Fighter Wing was relieved of its assignment to ACC and transferred to <ENT>Misawa<ENT> , Japan, on 1 October 1994. To assume the mission at Keflavik, the 85th Wing was activated on the same day.
Shanghai Pudong<SEP>The Shanghai Maglev Train, also known as the Transrapid, has a top speed of 430 km/h (270 mph). The line is the fastest and currently the first and only, commercially successful, operational high-speed maglev train, designed to connect <ENT>Shanghai Pudong<ENT> and the outskirts of central Pudong, Shanghai. It covers a distance of 30.5 km (19.0 mi) in 7 or 8 minutes. For the first time, the launch generated wide public interest and media attention, propelling the popularity of the mode of transportation. Despite over a century of research and development, currently high-speed maglev is only available in China and maglev transport systems are now operational in just three countries (Japan, South Korea and China). The incremental benefits of maglev technology have often been considered hard to justify against cost and risk, especially where there is an existing or proposed conventional high speed train line with spare passenger carrying capacity, as in high-speed rail in Europe, the High Speed 2 in the UK and Shinkansen in Japan.
Wells<SEP>Bothamley was born in Southwark and educated at St John's College, Oxford. He was ordained deacon in 1832; and Priest in 1833. but stayed at St John's, firstly as Fellow and then Tutor  until 1839. In that year he began studying for a PhD at the  University of Heidelberg. In 1862 he became Rector of Weston-Super-Mare; and in 1863 a Canon of <ENT>Wells<ENT> .
NYC<SEP>As of 2016 two Taiwanese airlines, China Airlines and EVA Air, provide private bus services to and from <ENT>NYC<ENT> in New York City for customers based in New Jersey. These bus services stop in Jersey City.
Cassino<SEP>Around 737, Boniface visited Rome. By this time Willibald had returned from his travels, and had become a monk at <ENT>Cassino<ENT> . Boniface recruited both nephews for the German mission. Willibald was ordained and based in Eichstätt. Boniface received a promise that Winnebald would go to Germany. Winibald arrived in Thuringia on 30 November, 740, and was ordained priest. He was placed in charge of seven churches, including one at Erfurt.
El Escorial<SEP>The dominion of Kirchheim was 1551 sold to Anton Fugger. Hans Fugger from 1578 to 1585 erected a glorious renaissance castle instead of the medieval castle complex. The castle was created after the model of the <ENT>El Escorial<ENT> near Madrid with integrated church. 1601 a friary of the Dominican Order is established. An own guild system is founded 1626. When trying to drain the swampy Mindel valley in 1581, the largest plow in the world, pulled by 102 horses, was used. One of the huge plowshares is preserved in the castle.
Comox<SEP>Three aerobatic shows are designed: a high show flown when weather is ideal, a low show and a flat show. The latter two are flown where some manoeuvres are not permitted because of cloud. A non-aerobatic show, or flypast, is also flown. Manoeuvres are arranged from those selected from the Standard Manoeuvre Manual. Some elements of the show are passed down from one season to the next. These include the Canada burst, heart, downward bomb burst, solo head on crosses, and their signature nine-abreast exit. Training occurs over several months. Once manoeuvres are mastered and the team is comfortable with the routine, the Snowbirds deploy to <ENT>Comox<ENT> for specialized training. After approvals are obtained, an "acceptance show" is performed at Moose Jaw to allow representatives from the three approving agencies to see a live performance. The team will go on to perform shows throughout North America from May to October. The last show is performed at Moose Jaw.
Brookwood<SEP>He married Navajbai Sett in 1893 and left for England in 1915. They adopted, Naval Tata from the family of a distant relative. He died on 5 September 1918 at St Ives in Cornwall, England and was buried at <ENT>Brookwood<ENT> , Woking, near London, by the side of his father (Jamsetji Tata).
Portland<SEP>Captain Herbert Richmond assumed command on 1 January 1919. By 1 May, Erin had been assigned to the 3rd Battle Squadron of the Home Fleet. In October, she was placed in reserve at the Nore but was stationed at <ENT>Portland<ENT> as of 18 November. Richmond was relieved by Captain Percival Hall-Thompson on 1 December. Erin had returned to the Nore by January 1920 and became a gunnery training ship there by February. By June, the ship had become flagship of Rear-Admiral Vivian Bernard, Rear-Admiral, Reserve Fleet, Nore. In July and August 1920, she underwent a refit at Devonport Dockyard. Through 18 December 1920, Erin remained Bernard's flagship and continued to serve as a gunnery training ship. The Royal Navy had originally intended that she should be retained as a training ship under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, but a change of plan meant that this role was filled by Thunderer, so the ship was listed for disposal in May 1922. Erin was sold to the ship-breaking firm of Cox and Danks on 19 December and broken up at Queenborough the following year.
Rugby<SEP>After a few years at <ENT>Rugby<ENT> , Sidgwick pursued undergraduate studies at Christ Church, Oxford, and a doctorate at the University of Tübingen. He received the MA from Lincoln College, Oxford, in October 1901, and spent almost his entire career in the city of his birth, becoming a Fellow of the college in 1901, and Professor of Chemistry from 1935 to 1945.
Shinagawa<SEP>Keikyū Tomioka Station (京急富岡駅, Keikyū Tomioka-eki) is a railway station operated by the Keikyū Keikyū Main Line located in Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. It is located 36.7 rail kilometers from the northern terminus of the Keikyū Main Line at <ENT>Shinagawa<ENT> , in Tokyo.
Cassino<SEP>About a quarter of a mile from the church are the remains of St Benet's, a monastery of the Benedictine order, said to have been subordinate to <ENT>Cassino<ENT> , in Italy, or according to others, Clairvaux in Burgundy. It was founded as a lazar house in 1411, and during the 15th century a chapel with a tower and an adjacent longhouse were built. The building work was not complete by 1430; it is mentioned in a document of 1535. The tower and longhouse are mentioned by Charles Henderson as being still in existence; he refutes the idea of it as an abbey. After the Reformation it became the home of the Courtenay family; the present house looks 19t–-century with 15th-century windows built into the facade. St Benet was restored by, its then owner, Charles Eldon Sargeant in 1878, and is described by The Cornishman newspaper as "... a charming and picturesque place".
Times Square<SEP>Their eldest son, Cyrus Lazelle Warner Eidlitz (1853–1921), was also an architect, designing the St. George Memorial House and founding the firm Eidlitz & McKenzie, designers of the original New York Times Building, <ENT>Times Square<ENT> (1903–05).
Brookwood<SEP>After his death on 12 October 1934, Clarkson was buried in a modest grave in the Actors' Acre in <ENT>Brookwood<ENT> in Surrey, England.
Haditha<SEP>F. R. Chesney reported about 1800 houses, two mosques, and 16 waterwheels. One minaret is particularly old. Northedge reported the locals commonly attributed it to the 11th century but opined that it was more likely from about a century after that. It rose from one of the islands and belonged to the local mosque. Dr. Muayad Said described it as an octagonal body "enhanced by alcoves, some of which are blind" and noted earlier conservation work undertaken in 1935, 1963 and 1964. When the valley was flooded by <ENT>Haditha<ENT> in 1984/85, the Iraqi State Board of Antiquities cut it into sections and removed it to the new Anah, where it was re-erected to a height of 28 meters (92 ft) at the end of the 1980s.
Oak Ridge nuclear facility<SEP>In 2013, Thapar was assigned to a case in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee due to the impending retirement of Judge Thomas Phillips from the Knoxville court. The case involved a high-profile break-in by peace protesters at <ENT>Oak Ridge nuclear facility<ENT> 's Highly Enriched Uranium Materials Facility in July 2012. The three protesters, aged 57 to 82, were convicted.
Ohio<SEP>At age 20, Ames became a student at <ENT>Ohio<ENT> at Athens. During his student years he united with the M.E. Church (August 1827). In 1828 he opened a high school in Lebanon, Illinois which later became McKendree University. He taught there until 1830, when he became a pastor in the Illinois Annual Conference. He was licensed to preach by the circuit rider (and presiding elder), Peter Cartwright.
Carnarvon<SEP>As a static structure, castles could often be avoided. Their immediate area of influence was about 400 metres (1,300 ft) and their weapons had a short range even early in the age of artillery. However, leaving an enemy behind would allow them to interfere with communications and make raids. Garrisons were expensive and as a result often small unless the castle was important. Cost also meant that in peacetime garrisons were smaller, and small castles were manned by perhaps a couple of watchmen and gate-guards. Even in war, garrisons were not necessarily large as too many people in a defending force would strain supplies and impair the castle's ability to withstand a long siege. In 1403, a force of 37 archers successfully defended <ENT>Carnarvon<ENT> against two assaults by Owain Glyndŵr's allies during a long siege, demonstrating that a small force could be effective.
Middlebury<SEP>In 1807, Ashmun was awarded an honorary degree by <ENT>Middlebury<ENT> , and moved to Northampton where he continued his law practice.
Chiswick<SEP>The castle (along with other Boyle properties – <ENT>Chiswick<ENT> , Burlington House, Bolton Abbey and Londesborough Hall) was acquired by the Cavendish family in 1753 when Lady Charlotte Boyle (1731-1754), the daughter and heiress of The 3rd Earl of Burlington and 4th Earl of Cork, married the Marquess of Hartington, who later became, in 1755, The 4th Duke of Devonshire (1720-1764), a future Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Great Britain. Their son, the 5th Duke (1748–1811), carried out improvements at Lismore, notably the bridge across the River Blackwater in 1775 which was designed by Cork-born architect Thomas Ivory.
Glastonbury<SEP>The church was a chapelry of Batcombe which, until the Dissolution of the Monasteries was controlled by <ENT>Glastonbury<ENT> .
South Bank<SEP>Since 2005, Rosner has collaborated with various musicians, including: Katia and Marielle Labeque, New World Symphony Orchestra and Michael Tilson Thomas, Esa-Pekka Salonen and Jennifer Koh. His video for In Seven Days, Piano Concerto with Moving Image, composed by Thomas Adès, was premiered by the London Sinfonietta at the Royal Festival Hall in London on 28 April 2008. The work was co-commissioned by <ENT>South Bank<ENT> and the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
Dinosaur<SEP>During his childhood, Adams often accompanied his father on walks and hikes through the woods on Sunday afternoons. He also enjoyed playing baseball in open fields and working with his father on carpentry projects. He was an active Boy Scout, and was also active with the Methodist church that his family attended. He and his father made several raft trips through <ENT>Dinosaur<ENT> , and during his adolescent years he worked at boys' camps at Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado. He also took trips on pack horses and went mountain climbing. He and his sister began visiting Denver Art Museum. Adams also learned to like reading. In 1955, he hunted for the last time.
Habbaniya<SEP>When Italy entered the war the Iraqi government did not break off diplomatic relations, as they had done with Germany. The Italian Legation in Baghdad became the centre for Axis propaganda and for fomenting anti-British feeling. In this they were aided by Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, the British appointee as the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, who had fled from the British Mandate of Palestine shortly before the outbreak of war and later received asylum in Baghdad. In January 1941, there was a political crisis within Iraq as Rashid Ali resigned as Prime Minister of Iraq and was replaced by Taha al-Hashimi; civil war loomed. On 31 March, the Regent of Iraq, Prince 'Abd al-Ilah, learnt of a plot to arrest him and fled Baghdad for <ENT>Habbaniya<ENT> , from whence he was flown to Basra and given refuge on the Insect class gunboat HMS Cockchafer.
Warwick<SEP>Early Medieval architecture's secular buildings were simple constructions mainly using timber with thatch for roofing. Ecclesiastical architecture ranged from a synthesis of Hiberno–Saxon monasticism, to Early Christian basilica and architecture characterised by pilaster-strips, blank arcading, baluster shafts and triangular headed openings. After the Norman conquest in 1066 various Castles in England were created so law lords could uphold their authority and in the north to protect from invasion. Some of the best-known medieval castles are the Tower of London, <ENT>Warwick<ENT> , Durham Castle and Windsor Castle.
Tippecanoe<SEP>Several monuments and memorial statues have been erected in tribute to Harrison. There are public statues of him in downtown Indianapolis, Cincinnati's Piatt Park, <ENT>Tippecanoe<ENT> , Harrison County, Indiana, and Owen County, Indiana. Numerous counties and towns also bear his name.
NYC<SEP>In the 1960s Iraqi Airways bought Russian Tupolev Tu-124 planes as well as Hawker Siddeley Trident aircraft. These jets allowed Iraqi Airways to increase service across the Middle East, to Africa and Europe. During that time, cargo aircraft such as the Ilyushin Il-76 were also purchased. During the 1970s, Iraqi Airways needed a bigger jet for a new route to <ENT>NYC<ENT> in New York, purchasing the Boeing 707 and, soon after, the Boeing 747.
Salamanca<SEP>In 1974, Hanke was elected President of the American Historical Association, the first Latin Americanist to hold the position.  In 1989, Hanke received the Kalman Silvert Award from Latin American Studies Association, and in 1992, was honored with the Antonio de Nebrija Fifth Centenary Special Prize from <ENT>Salamanca<ENT> .
San Siro<SEP>In 2009, it was reported that United continued to harbour plans to increase the capacity of the stadium further, with the next stage pointing to a redevelopment of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, which, unlike the rest of the stadium, remains single tier. A replication of the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand development and North-East and North-West Quadrants would see the stadium's capacity rise to an estimated 95,000, which would give it a greater capacity than Wembley Stadium (90,000). Any such development is likely to cost around £100 million, due to the proximity of the railway line that runs adjacent to the stadium, and the corresponding need to build over it and thus purchase up to 50 houses on the other side of the railway. Nevertheless, the Manchester United group property manager confirmed that expansion plans are in the pipeline – linked to profits made from the club's property holdings around Manchester – saying "There is a strategic plan for the stadium ... It is not our intention to stand still". One criticism of the plans, however, is that increasing the height of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand would further reduce the amount of light coming onto the pitch, which has caused problems in similarly large stadia – such as Wembley Stadium, the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium and <ENT>San Siro<ENT> ; according to Alex Ferguson, the developments on the other stands have already caused problems. It was also suggested that, should such an expansion take place, Old Trafford could be used instead of Wembley for big matches such as England internationals – in order to increase the ability of fans in the north of the country to watch England play; and FA Cup semi-finals – to maintain the prestige of the national stadium for the final.
Winchester<SEP>Udall was born in Hampshire and educated at <ENT>Winchester<ENT> and Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He was tutored under the guidance of Thomas Cromwell, who mentions him in a letter to John Creke of 17 August 1523 as 'Maister Woodall' and he appears again in Cromwell's accounts for 1535 as 'Nicholas Woodall Master of Eton'.
Fairford<SEP>The first Boeing KC-97E Stratotanker air refueling assigned to Strategic Air Command was delivered to the wing's 306th Air Refueling Squadron at MacDill AFB on 14 July 1951 and inflight refueling operations started in May 1952, with KC-97s refueling B-47s on operational training missions leading toward combat ready status.  B-47Bs from the 306th Bomb Wing began a 90-day rotational training mission to <ENT>Fairford<ENT> , England in June 1953, marking the first overseas deployment of the B-47.  Further overseas deployments by the entire wing followed in January 1955, October 1956, and October 1957 to Ben Guerir AB, Morocco. For its role in advancing jet bombardment tactics, the wing was awarded its first Air Force Outstanding Unit Award.
Glastonbury<SEP>When Chalice founder Ben Tao purchased 845 N. Highland in 2000, he chose to create an environment in which decorative detail could contribute to the artistic process. He wanted clients to be surrounded by amenities that one would normally find in upscale boutique hotels. The interior is influenced by global images and motifs such as photographs by Karl Blossfeld, artistic design from director Tarsem Singh's 'The Cell', imagery from 19th century Indo-Chinese opium dens and the Chalice Well located at the foot of <ENT>Glastonbury<ENT> in Somerset, England. Chalice's logo is a mix of the form of a goblet and the blossom of the opium flower.
Burlington<SEP>Other commercial airports include Portland International Jetport, Bangor International Airport, Worcester Regional Airport, and <ENT>Burlington<ENT> .
Rochester<SEP>Herland was commissioned by royalty to work on some of the major architecture of the time, including Windsor Castle, Westminster Palace, the Tower of London and <ENT>Rochester<ENT> , Portchester Castle and Winchester College Chapel, and he also contributed to the tombs of King Edward III and his Queen consort Philippa of Hainault in Westminster Abbey.
Highclere<SEP>Herbert was born at <ENT>Highclere<ENT> in Hampshire, the third son of Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon, a wealthy landowner, British cabinet minister, and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. His mother (his father's second wife and cousin) was Elizabeth Catherine Howard (1856-1929) ("Elsie"), a daughter of Henry Howard of Greystoke Castle, near Penrith, Cumberland, a son of Lord Henry Howard-Molyneux-Howard, younger brother of Bernard Howard, 12th Duke of Norfolk. Elizabeth Howard's brother was Esmé Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Penrith.
Blarney<SEP>Some of the most visited sites in Ireland include Bunratty Castle, the Rock of Cashel, the Cliffs of Moher, Holy Cross Abbey and <ENT>Blarney<ENT> . Historically important monastic sites include Glendalough and Clonmacnoise, which are maintained as national monuments in the Republic of Ireland.
Melbourne Airport<SEP>Melbourne's CityLink tollway (M1 and M2 sections) carry the highest volume of traffic and also generate the highest revenue of all the tollways (by a substantial amount). This is mainly due to the necessary cross-city and North ( <ENT>Melbourne Airport<ENT> -bound) corridors. Each respective city uses a different retailer to collect tolls, such as CityLink in Melbourne, e-Way, e-Toll, Roam and Transurban Linkt in Sydney and Linkt (formerly known as go via) in Brisbane.
Gallipoli<SEP>In 1403, Suleiman was in <ENT>Gallipoli<ENT> negotiating with a number of Christian states (Byzantium, Genoa, Venice, Knights Hospitaller and Naxos) in the Balkans in order to secure an agreement with them and start an offensive against his brothers in Asia Minor. The terms of the agreement were that Byzantium was to cease being a vassal of the Ottoman, while in the territorial sense, regain Thessaloniki and a number of cities on the coast of the Bosphorus and Black Sea. One of the provisions of this contract referred to Stefan, although he probably did not take part in its conclusion. Stefan kept his former possessions, but had to still pay tribute and send the Sultan support militarily, although he was not obliged to lead them himself.
Ramstein<SEP>The 496th FIS was activated on March 20, 1953, as a fighter-interceptor squadron at Hamilton as part of the west coast air defense forces. Partially equipped at first with six F-51Ds, the squadron soon transitioned to F-86D aircraft and prepared to move to Europe. In August 1954 the 496th FIS was transferred to Hahn Air Base West Germany to stand air defense alert. Although based at Hahn, the 496th FIS was assigned to the USAFE 86th Fighter-Interceptor Wing at <ENT>Ramstein<ENT> .
Southampton<SEP>SUFE has embraced internationalization and regularly collaborates with such institutions as the World Bank Institute (WBI), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). In addition, SUFE works closely with international professional organizations, such as the UK’s Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), Canada’s Certified General Accountant (CGA), the USA’s Life Office Management Association (LOMA) and the UK’s Chartered Insurance Institute (CII). In addition, SUFE also cooperates with a number of foreign universities, including Webster University (USA), <ENT>Southampton<ENT> (UK), the University of Brunel (UK), Deakin University (Australia), the University of Vaasa (Finland), Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Gifu University (Japan), among others. SUFE has created six joint undergraduate programs, which cover the following subjects: economics, real estate management, accounting, finance, international business and international economics and trade. SUFE has signed multiple foreign exchange student agreements and established a number of training centers for international examinations.
Salisbury<SEP>The designation of styles in English Gothic architecture follow conventional labels given them by the antiquary Thomas Rickman, who coined the terms in his Attempt to Discriminate the Style of Architecture in England (1812–15). Historians sometimes refer to the styles as "periods", e.g. "Perpendicular period" in much the same way as an historical era may be referred to as the "Tudor period". The various styles are seen at their most fully developed in the cathedrals, abbey churches and collegiate buildings. It is, however, a distinctive characteristic of the cathedrals of England that all but one of them, <ENT>Salisbury<ENT> , show great stylistic diversity and have building dates that typically range over 400 years.
Falkirk<SEP> <ENT>Falkirk<ENT> , the world's first rotating boat lift, acts as the centrepiece of the restoration of the Forth and Clyde and Union Canals. The Wheel replaced a flight of locks which formerly connected the canals and which were filled in in 1930. It was the winning design in a competition to design a new lock. Visitors can now take a boat trip on the Wheel and be lifted over 100 feet (30 m) in a few minutes compared to the time it took when the original lock staircase operated.
Oak Ridge<SEP>In 1977, the SLATEC Common Mathematical Library (CML) Subcommittee decided to construct a library of FORTRAN subprograms to provide portable, non-proprietary, mathematical software that could be used on a variety of computers, including  supercomputers, at the three sites. The computers centers of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the National Bureau of Standards and <ENT>Oak Ridge<ENT> also participated from 1980–81 onwards.
Sarum<SEP>From 1925 to 1928, he was Officer Commanding 16 Squadron, based at <ENT>Sarum<ENT> , Wiltshire, operating the Bristol F.2 Fighter in the tactical reconnaissance role.
Dinosaur<SEP>The Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP) came before Congress in the early to mid-1950s. The bill, sponsored by Wayne Aspinall and several western allies, called for damming several areas in the Upper Basin of the Colorado River. It included the Echo Park Dam proposal, located within <ENT>Dinosaur<ENT> . This became a volatile issue between environmentalists and water project advocates. Located just below the Green and Yampa Rivers, the proposed 525-foot (160 m) high dam would have created a 43,000 acre (170 km²) lake, flooding the Green River Canyon for 63 miles (101 km) and the Yampa River Canyon for 44 miles (71 km). However, because of increased environmental awareness around the country, the majority of the public opposed the project. In 1954 alone, the Department of the Interior received 20,000 pieces of mail about the plan, and one insider estimated the letters ran 80 to 1 in opposition of the project.
French Creek<SEP>Many examples of West Virginia's present and former megafauna are on display at <ENT>French Creek<ENT> , a small zoo featuring native animals.
Springfield<SEP>Western Massachusetts is a region in Massachusetts, one of the six U.S. states that make up the New England region of the United States. Western Massachusetts has diverse topography; 22 universities, with approximately 100,000 university students; and such institutions as Tanglewood, <ENT>Springfield<ENT> , and Jacob's Pillow.
Oak Ridge nuclear facility<SEP>In 1953, Robert W. Bussard, a physicist working on the Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft (NEPA) project at <ENT>Oak Ridge nuclear facility<ENT> wrote a detailed study. He had read Cleaver and Shepard's work, that of Tsien, and a February 1952 report by engineers at Consolidated Vultee. He used data and analyses from existing chemical rockets, along with specifications for existing components. His calculations were based on the state of the art of nuclear reactors. Most importantly, the paper surveyed several ranges and payload sizes; Consolidated's pessimistic conclusions had partly been the result of considering only a narrow range of possibilities.
Lambeth<SEP>In November 1901 Gore was nominated to succeed J. J. S. Perowne as Bishop of Worcester. The appointment caused some controversy, due to his teachings and relationship to the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury (he was a cousin of Lord Salisbury's daughter-in-law). The Church Association and the Liverpool Laymen's League were among societies lodging formal protests before his confirmation. After subsequent legal hearings, Gore was consecrated as Bishop at <ENT>Lambeth<ENT> on 23 February 1902, and enthroned at Worcester Cathedral two days later on 25 February.
Charing Cross<SEP>The other Carlisle House was a large mansion on the east side of Soho Square, at the south corner of Sutton Street, with rear buildings on Sutton Street and in Hog Lane, now <ENT>Charing Cross<ENT> . This was the main house on the square. The first definitely known occupant of this house, in 1685, was Edward Howard, second Earl of Carlisle. While Lady Carlisle lived in the other Carlisle House, this one was the residence of her son, Lord Morpeth, who became the fourth Earl in 1738. There is rumoured to have been a tunnel between the two houses. In 1753, he sold it to an upholstery business, which used the stables and coach house in Hog Lane as their workshop and rented the house to the envoy of the King of Naples, who lived there from 1754 to 1758. An outbuilding on Sutton Street was made into a Catholic chapel for him and his staff. In summer 1759, three special Dutch envoys occupied the house.
Oak Ridge atomic plant<SEP>NEC's linear accelerators range in voltage from a few kilovolts to a 25 Megavolt machine at <ENT>Oak Ridge atomic plant<ENT> - the highest-voltage accelerator in the world as of 2010.
Oak Ridge<SEP>In the US, ZEB research is currently being supported by the US Department of Energy (DOE) Building America Program, including industry-based consortia and researcher organizations at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the Florida Solar Energy Center (FSEC), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), and <ENT>Oak Ridge<ENT> (ORNL).  From fiscal year 2008 to 2012, DOE plans to award $40 million to four Building America teams, the Building Science Corporation; IBACOS; the Consortium of Advanced Residential Buildings; and the Building Industry Research Alliance, as well as a consortium of academic and building industry leaders. The funds will be used to develop net-zero-energy homes that consume 50% to 70% less energy than conventional homes.
Stirling<SEP>In the late twelfth century, Giraldus Cambrensis noted that "in the opinion of many, Scotland not only equals its teacher, Ireland, but indeed greatly outdoes it and excels her in musical skill". He identified the Scots as using the cithara, tympanum and chorus, although what exactly these instruments were is unclear. Bards probably accompanied their poetry on the harp, and can also be seen in records of the Scottish courts throughout the Medieval period. Scottish church music from the thirteenth century was increasingly influenced by continental developments, with figures like the musical theorist Simon Tailler studying in Paris, before returned to Scotland where he introduced several reforms of church music. Scottish collections of music like the thirteenth century 'Wolfenbüttel 677', which is associated with St Andrews, contain mostly French compositions, but with some distinctive local styles. The captivity of James I in England from 1406 to 1423, where he earned a reputation as a poet and composer, may have led him to take English and continental styles and musicians back to the Scottish court on his release. In the late fifteenth century a series of Scottish musicians trained in the Netherlands before returning home, including John Broune, Thomas Inglis and John Fety, the last of whom became master of the song school in Aberdeen and then Edinburgh, introducing the new five-fingered organ playing technique. In 1501 James IV refounded the Chapel Royal within <ENT>Stirling<ENT> , with a new and enlarged choir and it became the focus of Scottish liturgical music. Burgundian and English influences were probably reinforced when Henry VII's daughter Margaret Tudor married James IV in 1503.
Bayonne<SEP>Western part of the Kill from <ENT>Bayonne<ENT> 
NYC<SEP>The jet age arrived in Billings by 1966 when Northwest introduced Boeing 727-100 "Fan Jet" flights in addition to its Electra turboprop service.  In 1968, Northwest was operating nonstop 727 jet service from the airport to Chicago O'Hare International Airport, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Great Falls and Spokane as well as direct, no change of plane 727 flights to New York <ENT>NYC<ENT> , Newark, Washington, D.C. National Airport, Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee, Seattle and Portland, OR.
Dachau<SEP>After V-E Day in 1945, General Lucius D. Clay asked for Marcus to serve on his staff in the occupation of Germany. Marcus was in charge of providing for the millions of displaced persons in Germany. Clay required all his subordinates to tour <ENT>Dachau<ENT> . Marcus was shocked by its horrors; though not previously a Zionist, he began to think differently about a Jewish state.
Matsumoto<SEP>Himekawa Station is served by the Ōito Line and is 32.2 kilometers from the intermediate terminus of the line at Minami-Otari Station, and is 102.2 kilometers from the terminus of the line at <ENT>Matsumoto<ENT> .
Ely<SEP>The sixth tour returned to Japan with a production of Macbeth (directed by Tom Adams), set in Edwardian Britain. The Players spent a week with principle sponsors, Seikei University, along with shows and workshops at Meiji University, Daito Bunka University and two international schools. In addition, the Players performed two sell-out public performances at Nigiwai-za in Yokohama and led workshops at the Kanto Plains Drama Festival. Four pre-tour performances were held at <ENT>Ely<ENT> and the Round Church in Cambridge, followed by a post-tour home run at the Corpus Playroom.
Oak Ridge nuclear facility<SEP>In September 2010, Nvidia announced that the successor to Fermi microarchitecture would be the Kepler microarchitecture, manufactured with the TSMC 28 nm fabrication process. Earlier, Nvidia had been contracted to supply their top-end GK110 cores for use in <ENT>Oak Ridge nuclear facility<ENT> 's "Titan" supercomputer, leading to a shortage of GK110 cores.  After AMD launched their own annual refresh in early 2012, the Radeon HD 7000 series, Nvidia began the release of the GeForce 600 series in March 2012.  The GK104 core, originally intended for their mid-range segment of their lineup, became the flagship GTX 680.  It introduced significant improvements in performance, heat, and power efficiency compared to the Fermi architecture and closely matched AMD's flagship Radeon HD 7970.  It was quickly followed by the dual-GK104 GTX 690 and the GTX 670, which featured only a slightly cut-down GK104 core and was very close in performance to the GTX 680.
Dalkeith<SEP>In December 1592 he married his second wife Marie Stewart, daughter of Esmé Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox at Holyroodhouse. The marriage was intended to be held at <ENT>Dalkeith<ENT> but was delayed by Mar's illness, the match was opposed by many because Mary was a Catholic. Their daughter, Lady Mary Erskine, married William Keith, 5th Earl Marischal.
Blarney<SEP>In 2001 Edmond rode Kings Highway at <ENT>Blarney<ENT> in the CCI**, their first International Horse Trials together, where the pair finished 8th. In the same year they ended up in 23rd place in the CCI*** at Boekelo . In 2002 they completed the CCI*** at Punchestown  and later that year the duo were to record 9th Place at the Blenheim CCI*** . As the Olympics grew near, in 2003 Gibney upped the ante yet again, recording 11th place at Belton Park in the Advanced section.  However it was at the Badminton CCI****  in 2003 that the pair shone, winning the Glentrool Trophy for a superb showing in the cross country and ending up in 19th place overall.
Oak Ridge atomic plant<SEP>When Wilkins's team was about to be transferred to <ENT>Oak Ridge atomic plant<ENT> in Oak Ridge, Tennessee (known at the time as site "X"), due to the Jim Crow laws of the Southern United States, Wilkins would have been prevented from working there. When Edward Teller was informed about this, he wrote a letter on September 18, 1944 to Harold Urey (who was the director of war research at Columbia at the time) of Wilkins's abilities, informing him about the problem of Wilkins's race, and recommending his services for a new position. As Teller explained:
Vatican<SEP>Years 1880-1882 marked his work on another large painting, Prussian Tribute (Hołd Pruski). Matejko gifted this painting to "the Polish nation", and it earned him honorary citizenship of Kraków; one of the squares in the city was also named Matejko Square. In 1883 he finished Sobieski at Vienna (Jan Sobieski pod Wiedniem). Sobieski... was gifted to Pope Leo XIII as a "gift of the Polish nation" and Matejko, who was one of the members of the group delivering it, received a Knight Commander with Star Order of Pius IX. The painting is exhibited in the Sobieski Room of <ENT>Vatican<ENT> .At that time he also became a vocal spokesman in a number of political issues, publishing letters on issues such as Polish-Russian relations. Another arena he was very engaged in were efforts to protect and reconstruct various historical monuments in the city of Kraków. In 1886, he finished a painting about French rather than about Polish history: Virgin of Orléans, portraying Joan of Arc.
Arecibo<SEP>In 2002, the asteroid was detected by radar from <ENT>Arecibo<ENT> at a distance of 1.31 AU. The resulting data yielded an effective diameter of 70 ± 10 km.
Falkirk<SEP>The Bank of Scotland £50 note is a banknote of the pound sterling. It is the second largest of five banknote denominations issued by the Bank of Scotland. The current cotton note, first issued in 2007 bears the image of Walter Scott on the obverse and a vignette of <ENT>Falkirk<ENT> on the reverse.
Vancouver<SEP>In 1828 George Simpson visited the river, mainly to examine Fort Langley and determine whether it would be suitable as the Hudson's Bay Company's main Pacific depot. Simpson had believed the Fraser River might be navigable throughout its length, even though Simon Fraser had described it as non-navigable. Simpson journeyed down the river and through the Fraser Canyon and afterwards wrote "I should consider the passage down, to be certain Death, in nine attempts out of Ten. I shall therefore no longer talk about it as a navigable stream". His trip down the river convinced him that Fort Langley could not replace <ENT>Vancouver<ENT> as the company's main depot on the Pacific coast.
Mackinac<SEP>Late in 1813, he was appointed Adjutant to Lieutenant Colonel Robert McDouall, newly appointed commander of the post at <ENT>Mackinac<ENT> . Leading a party of the Royal Newfoundlanders, he was slightly wounded in the Engagement on Lake Huron in which two American gunboats were captured, saving the British post from blockade and starvation.
Los Alamos<SEP>In 1942, the U.S. government bought 692 acres (280 ha) of ranch land, bounded by Vasco and Greenville roads and East Avenue, and built the Livermore Naval Air Station. The primary mission of the base was to train Navy pilots. This facility operated until it was decommissioned in 1946 after the end of World War II. On 5 January 1951, the Bureau of Yards and Docks, U.S. Navy, formally transferred the former NAS Livermore in its entirety to the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) for use by the University of California's Radiation Laboratory. In 1952, the government established Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), named after famous physicist Ernest O. Lawrence, as the site of a second laboratory for the study of nuclear energy like the research being done at <ENT>Los Alamos<ENT> . The laboratory was run by the University of California. Edward Teller was a co-founder of LLNL and was both its director and associate director for many years. In 1956, the California campus of Sandia National Laboratories opened across East Avenue from LLNL. Both LLNL and Sandia are technically on U.S. government property just outside the city's jurisdiction limits, but with employment at LLNL at about 6,800 and Sandia/California at about 1,150 they are Livermore's largest employers.
Oak Ridge<SEP>Reactivated in 1954 as part of the United States Air Force Air Defense Command, stationed at Knoxville, Tennessee for air defense of <ENT>Oak Ridge<ENT> and TVA Dams in Eastern Tennessee.   Moved to Portland Airport, Oregon and flew air defense missions over the Pacific Northwest, later to Southern California in 1968.    When Oxnard Air Force Base closed in 1969, moved to Grand Forks AFB, North Dakota until inactivated as part of the drawdown of ADC in 1974.
Glastonbury<SEP>Until 1949 East Huntspill was part of the ancient parish and civil parish of Huntspill. The first mention of Huntspill is around 796 AD, when the area was granted to <ENT>Glastonbury<ENT> by Aethelmund, a nobleman under King Offa of Mercia.
Salisbury<SEP>His fame spread, and in 1641 he was appointed chaplain and tutor to the future Charles II of England. In 1643 he was elected one of the Westminster Assembly, but his sympathies with Charles I of England and with the Anglican Communion were so strong that he declined to sit. Early in 1643 he was chosen chancellor of <ENT>Salisbury<ENT> , but he was soon deprived of this position as a "malignant." After the final Royalist defeat at the Battle of Worcester, Earle went abroad, and was made Clerk of the Closet (1651–1664) and chaplain to his former student Charles II.
Oak Ridge atomic plant<SEP>During World War II Hurd taught at the US Coast Guard Academy with the rank of Lieutenant Commander, and co-authored the textbook for teaching Mathematics to mariners. From 1945 to 1947 he was dean of Allegheny College. In 1947 he moved to  Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where he worked for Union Carbide as mathematician at the United States Atomic Energy Commission facility <ENT>Oak Ridge atomic plant<ENT> . He taught and later served as a technical research head under Alston Scott Householder.  At Oak Ridge he supervised the installation of an IBM 602 calculating punched card machine to automate the tracking of material in the facility, and saw the potential for automating the massive amounts of computation needed for nuclear Physics research. In February 1948 he was invited to the dedication of the IBM Selective Sequence Electronic Calculator (SSEC), a custom-built machine in New York City. He asked if the SSEC could be used for calculations being done at Oak Ridge for the NEPA project to power an airplane with a nuclear reactor, but the demands for the SSEC produced a backlog. In the meanwhile, he requested that the first IBM 604 calculating card punch be delivered to Oak Ridge. It was, but the calculations remained slow with the limited electronics in the 604.
Stirling<SEP>He was promoted to the bishopric of Dunblane, receiving a Crown provision on 24 September 1615 and was consecrated by April of the following year. Balfour Paul states that he was also appointed, c. 1633, Dean of the Chapel Royal at <ENT>Stirling<ENT> , and also held, as a personal right, Kilconquhar, succeeding to it upon the death of his nephew James, which was ratified in parliament in 1629. However, it is evident that Bellenden was appointed Dean of the Chapel Royal much earlier than Balfour Paul stated, as in 1621 the Privy Council of Scotland ordered that the widow of the previous Dean, William Couper, Bishop of Galloway, hand over documents relating to the Chapel Royal to Bellenden, and specifically called Bellenden 'deane of his Majesteis Chaippell'.
Salisbury<SEP>From 1403, Ullerston held the prebend of Oxford in <ENT>Salisbury<ENT> , and from 1407 the rectory of Beeford in Yorkshire.
Monte Carlo<SEP>The tournament was held partly at the "Stade Nautique du Port" at the Monaco harbour and partly at the "Tir aux Pigeons" in the gardens Les jardins du Casino of <ENT>Monte Carlo<ENT> .
Zwettl<SEP>Janauschek was born at Brünn, Moravia. In 1846 he received the religious habit at the <ENT>Zwettl<ENT> , Lower Austria, where he was professed in 1848. His superiors then sent him to their house of studies at Heiligenkreuz Abbey near Vienna, where he studied philosophy and theology. After his ordination to the priesthood he was made professor of history and canon law. His scholarly works attracted attention and won for him in 1858 the chair of ecclesiastical history in the University of Vienna.
Sandringham<SEP>R101 made its first flight on 14 October. After a short circuit over Bedford, course was set for London, where it passed over the Palace of Westminster, St Paul's Cathedral and the City, returning to Cardington after a flight lasting five hours 40 minutes. During this flight the servos were not used, without any difficulty being experienced in controlling the airship. A second flight lasting nine hours 38 minutes followed on 18 October, with Lord Thomson among the passengers, after which R101 was briefly returned to the shed to enable some modifications to be made to the starting engines. A third flight lasting seven hours 15 minutes was made on 1 November, during which it was flown at full power for the first time, recording a speed of 68.5 mph (110.2 km/h): even at full speed it was not found necessary to use the control servos.  During this flight it paid a visit to the Boulton and Paul works near Nottingham and also circled over <ENT>Sandringham<ENT> , observed by the King and Queen. On 2 November the first night flight was made, slipping the mast at 20:12 before heading south to fly over London and Portsmouth before attempting a speed trial over a 43 mi (69 km) circuit over the Solent and the Isle of Wight. These trials were frustrated by pipe breakages in the cooling systems of two of the engines, a problem later solved by replacing the aluminium piping with copper. It returned to Cardington around 09:00, the mooring operation ending in a minor accident, damaging one of the reefing booms at the bow.
Southwark<SEP>Griggs was educated at Brentwood School (Essex) and  Trinity Hall, Cambridge before embarking on an ecclesiastical career with a Curacy at St Cuthbert’s, Portsmouth. After  incumbencies at Sheffield he was appointed Archdeacon then Bishop of Ludlow. He was consecrated a bishop on 22 July 1987, by Robert Runcie, Archbishop of Canterbury, at <ENT>Southwark<ENT> .
Harewood<SEP>As a child, he lived at Goldsborough Hall in Goldsborough, North Yorkshire, which was the house for the heirs-in-waiting for <ENT>Harewood<ENT> . During his lifetime the Lascelles family were still major landholders in Barbados.
Elsinore<SEP>In the late summer of 1807 she returned to Copenhagen where she participated in the second Battle of Copenhagen. After the surrender of the Danish fleet, Nassau, on  21 October 1807, was one of the vessels that escorted the surrendered Danish ships from Holmen to <ENT>Elsinore<ENT> . She then remained in Danish waters until February 1809.
Ascot<SEP>Shirley Heights showed promise as a two-year-old, winning twice from six attempts and notably taking the one-mile Royal Lodge Stakes at <ENT>Ascot<ENT> in September at odds of 10/1. The Royal Lodge was the first time he was ridden by Greville Starkey, who had taken over from the Australian veteran Ron Hutchinson as the principal jockey to the Dunlop stable.
HURN<SEP>Canadair built 39 Canadair CL-44]/Canadair CC-106 Yukon turboprop Rolls-Royce Tyne-powered aircraft, comprising 12 CC-106 Yukon for the RCAF and 27 CL-44D4 passenger/cargo variants for the civil market, most of which were used as freighters. Four CL-44D4s were converted as CL-44Js with lengthened fuselages for service with the Icelandic "budget" airline Loftleiðir. The CL-44D4s were all built with swing-tails to allow straight-in cargo loading and served with a variety of carriers, most notably Flying Tiger Line. The similar CC-106 Yukon was used by the RCAF in a solely passenger configuration. A final unique "one-off" development was the Conroy Skymonster, nicknamed Guppy, based on a Canadair CL-44D4 N447T. The most prominent modification was an enlarged fuselage, like the Mini Guppy, which was produced by Jack Conroy's previous company, Aero Spacelines. After a long operational career as a freighter, the Guppy was stored at <ENT>HURN<ENT> in 2003 and has recently been sold.
Molesworth<SEP>On 11 November 1940, Brill transferred to the RAAF active reserve, known as the Citizen Air Force (CAF).  He went through the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS), undergoing initial instruction at RAAF Bradfield Park in Sydney. Selected to be a pilot, he received his elementary flying training on De Havilland Tiger Moths at RAAF Station Narrandera. In March 1941, Brill was posted to Canada for advanced instruction on Avro Ansons at No. 3 Service Flying Training School, Calgary. He was commissioned as a pilot officer on 28 July 1941, and sailed to Britain the next month. In October he began converting to Vickers Wellington medium bombers at No. 27 Operational Training Unit, Lichfield, and was assigned to No. 460 Squadron RAAF, which formed at <ENT>Molesworth<ENT> the following month.
Malmesbury<SEP>Walter was a witness of a charter where Queen Matilda granted 3 hides at Garsdon in Wiltshire to <ENT>Malmesbury<ENT> .
Fort Hall<SEP>Wyeth and crew attempted various commercial interests from their outpost in the Pacific Northwest. They cut lumber and exported it to the Hawaiian Islands, built boats and canoes, and built a 60-foot (18 m)-long building to use in processing fish.  They intended to ship salmon to the East and to Hawaii.  Wyeth and his employees also attempted to trap animals in the Deschutes River watershed of central Oregon. They were unsuccessful and the young company was unable to survive against the HBC and, in the Rocky Mountains, the American Fur Company, made a monopoly by John Jacob Astor. John Ball, one of Wyeth's men, wrote that they were no match for the HBC, which up fur trade prices as much as ten to one whenever any American trader appeared on the lower Columbia River. The post had difficulties; its first supply ship sent to the Northwest Coast wrecked, and the second ship was late. The first ship was being used to export salmon. Wyeth abandoned the post in 1836 and the following year, leased it to the Hudson’s Bay Company. After Wyeth left the Pacific Northwest, John McLoughlin, the Chief Factor at Fort Vancouver, ordered Fort William demolished and a dairy farm built on the island. Wyeth also sold <ENT>Fort Hall<ENT> in present-day Idaho to the HBC the following year.
Wells<SEP>Denys Pouncey (1906–1999) was an English cathedral organist, who served in <ENT>Wells<ENT> 
South Bank<SEP>Prior first collaborated with architect Frances Crow in 1997 on Triptych, an installation jointly commissioned by SPNM and <ENT>South Bank<ENT> , London. They worked together again on the Arts Council funded Good Vibrations children's education project in 1999 but it wasn't until 2003 that they formally established Liminal, a design studio with a particular interest in exploring sound and architecture. The partnership has resulted in projects ranging from installations to sound-walks as well as commercial sound design and consultancy and a number of theoretical publications and conference papers. Liminal was formed as a company in order to undertake Swash (2003), a large-scale, immersive sound installation for Living Coasts in Devon and in keeping with other recent work, this piece has evolved into a number of different iterations. Two years after the completion of the installation version of Swash, Prior made an eight-channel, acousmatic concert version of the piece which was first performed at the Martin Harris Hall in Manchester as part of the Sonic Arts Expo, 2006. In 2007, Prior was commissioned by the SpACE-Net spatial audio research group in York to produce a third, improvised version of the work which has been performed a number of times subsequently. Following the completion of Swash, liminal were made lead sound designers for the Churchill Museum in London designed by celebrated designers Casson Mann. The Churchill Museum has gone on to win a string of awards and was nominated for both the D&AD Award for Outstanding Achievement in Digital Installations and the 2006 Gulbenkian Prize.
West Edmonton<SEP>Residents have access to <ENT>West Edmonton<ENT> to the north along both 170 Street and 178 Street.
Armagh<SEP>The Irish Astronomical Society was founded in October 1937.  The core group in its formative years included Joseph MacDermott, Uinsionn S. Deiseach (Vincent Deasy), Lorcan O hUiginn, Veronica Burns, M. A. Magennis, H. A. Haughton, Muiris Mac Ionnraic, Mrs. M. Jones, William Farquharson and William R. Mackle. It was reorganised in 1947 to allow local centres to work under a central committee. It published the Irish Astronomical Journal every quarter from 1949 to 1959. Later, Dunsink Observatory and <ENT>Armagh<ENT> took over publication of the journal.

Haditha<SEP>On 27 July 2014, USS Bataan began deploying USMC AV-8Bs over Iraq to provide surveillance of Islamic State (IS) forces. Surveillance operations continued after the start of Operation Inherent Resolve against IS militants. In early September 2014, a USMC Harrier from the 22nd MEU struck an IS target near <ENT>Haditha<ENT> in Iraq, marking the first time a USMC unit dropped ordnance in the operation. On 1 August 2016, USMC Harriers from USS Wasp began strikes against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in Libya as part of manned and unmanned airstrikes on targets near Sirte, launching at least five times within two days.
Auschwitz<SEP>In Greece, the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS encountered resistance from the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and Greek Army. The fighting was intensified by the mountainous terrain, with its heavily defended narrow passes. The LSSAH was at the forefront of the German push. The BEF evacuated by sea to Crete, but had to flee again in late May when the Germans arrived. Like Yugoslavia, the conquest of Greece brought its Jews into danger, as the Nazis immediately took a variety of measures against them. Initially confined in ghettos, most were transported to <ENT>Auschwitz<ENT> in March 1943, where they were killed in the gas chambers on arrival. Of Greece's 80,000 Jews, only 20 percent survived the war.
Brookwood<SEP>In 1861 and 1862 he served on commissions appointed to consider the construction of embankments of the River Thames, and of communications between the embankment at Blackfriars Bridge and the Mansion House, and between Westminster Bridge and Millbank. He died suddenly on 26 June 1863 and was buried in <ENT>Brookwood<ENT> .  His successor as Survey General of Prisons was another Royal Engineers officer, Major Edmund Henderson.
Oak Ridge nuclear facility<SEP>Prior to his work with the University of Illinois, Michael Heath spent a number of years at <ENT>Oak Ridge nuclear facility<ENT> .  Heath joined Oak Ridge in 1968 as a Scientific Applications Programmer, and he became a Eugene P. Wigner Postdoctoral Fellow in 1978.
Oak Ridge nuclear facility<SEP>In January 2016, the United States Department of Energy announced a $80m award fund to develop Generation IV reactor designs. One of two beneficiaries, Southern Company Services will use the funding to develop a Molten Chloride Fast Reactor, a type of MSR developed earlier by British scientists at Atomic Energy Research Establishment. It will partner with TerraPower, Electric Power Research Institute, Vanderbilt University and <ENT>Oak Ridge nuclear facility<ENT> ; presumably in conjunction with sister division Southern Nuclear.

West Edmonton<SEP>In 2013, E-Ville hosted what was billed as "Canada's first roller derby championships" at <ENT>West Edmonton<ENT> , in which they finished in third place. During 2014, E-Ville Roller Derby moved to Edmonton Sportsdome due the demolition of Mayfield Trade Center. The league celebrated its tenth anniversary in 2016.
Hejaz<SEP>Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr ibn al-Awwam (Arabic: عبد الله ابن الزبير ابن العوام‎, romanized: ʿAbd Allāh ibn al-Zubayr ibn al-ʿAwwām; May 624 — October/November 692) was the leader of a caliphate based in Mecca that rivaled the Umayyads from 683 until his death. The son of al-Zubayr ibn al-Awwam and Asma bint Abi Bakr, Ibn al-Zubayr belonged to the Quraysh, the leading tribe of the nascent Muslim community, and was the first child born to the Muhajirun, Islam's earliest converts. As a youth, he participated in the early Muslim conquests alongside his father in Syria and Egypt, and later played a role in the Muslim conquests of North Africa and northern Iran in 647 and 650, respectively. During the First Muslim Civil War, he fought on the side of his aunt A'isha against Caliph Ali (r. 656–661). Though little is heard of Ibn al-Zubayr during the subsequent reign of the first Umayyad caliph Mu'awiya I (r. 661–680), it was known that he opposed the latter's designation of his son, Yazid I, as his successor. Ibn al-Zubayr, along with much of the Quraysh and the Ansar, the leading Muslim groups of <ENT>Hejaz<ENT> (western Arabia), opposed the caliphate becoming an inheritable institution of the Umayyads.
Monte Carlo<SEP>Marie Charlotte Blanc (née Hensel; 23 September 1833 – 25 July 1881) was a German socialite and businesswoman. She was a prominent member of high society in Monaco and France. After the death of her husband,  François Blanc, she operated <ENT>Monte Carlo<ENT> .
Mystic<SEP>Ted Wells won the 1947 and 1949 Snipe Worlds, the 1952 Western Hemispheres and three National Championships (1947, 1949, and 1952). He was Snipe Class International Racing Association (SCIRA) Commodore in 1954, and published “Scientific Sailboat Racing” His boat "Good News III" (Sail number 6025) is stored at <ENT>Mystic<ENT> .
Oak Ridge<SEP>CFD-ACE+ solver allows for coupled heat and mass transport along with complex multi-step gas-phase and surface reactions which makes it especially useful for designing and optimizing  semiconductor equipment and processes such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Researchers at the Ecole Nationale Superieure d'Arts et Metiers used CFD-ACE+ to simulate the rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition (RTCVD) process. They predicted the deposition rate along the substrate diameter for silicon deposition from silane. They also used CFD-ACE+ to model transparent conductive oxide (TCO) thin film deposition with ultrasonic spray chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The University of Louisville and <ENT>Oak Ridge<ENT> used CFD-ACE+ to develop the yttria-stabilized zirconia CVD process for application of thermal barrier coatings for fossil energy systems.
Rugby<SEP>George Shuckburgh was born on 23 August 1751, the son of Richard Shuckburgh of Limerick. He was educated at <ENT>Rugby<ENT> and Balliol College, Oxford, from which he earned a bachelor's degree in 1772.
Watts<SEP>The Tower of Wooden Pallets was designated a historic-cultural monument, which had the same rights and recognition as the Hollywood Sign, <ENT>Watts<ENT> , and the cruise ship Catalina. Van Meter enjoyed his special "dwelling" as a hangout to get away from the frenzy of urban society and claimed his tower of some 2,000 rejected broken-down wooden beer pallets surrounded a "Tree of Heaven." Van Meter said he climbed to the top of the wooden structure and looked at the moon and the stars at night. It was a spiritual place to him.
Winchester<SEP>Fowler was initially educated at home but then attended Evans' preparatory school at Horris Hill and <ENT>Winchester<ENT> . He won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge and read mathematics, becoming a wrangler in Part II of the Mathematical Tripos.
Chantilly<SEP>Solford was scheduled to make his three-year-old debut in the Ballysax Race at the Curragh in April but was withdrawn just before the race after appearing sickly in the paddock. He was found to be running a slight temperature and was suffering from a skin condition. After more than a month of the course he returned for a race over ten furlongs at Phoenix Park Racecourse in which he was matched against his stable companion Caerleon. Ridden by the stable's first-choice jockey Pat Eddery Solford started favourite and won by three-quarters of a length from Caerleon, who was carrying eight pounds more. On the day in June that Caerleon won the Prix du Jockey Club over 2400 metres at <ENT>Chantilly<ENT> , Solford contested the Group Three Prix du Lys over the same course and distance. Wearing blinkers for the only time in his career, Solford started the 1/2 favourite and won easily from moderate opposition.
West Edmonton<SEP>Kingsway Mall is the second largest mall in Edmonton, behind <ENT>West Edmonton<ENT> . The mall contains over 200 stores and services including Hudson's Bay, Sport Chek, H&M, Marshalls/HomeSense, and Forever 21. The mall has two main shopping levels (with one store situated in the basement) and a third floor consisting of professional offices. Over 3,900 parking stalls surround the mall, in two levels on the east side, as well as Edmonton Transit System services at the Kingsway/Royal Alex LRT Station.
Kenilworth<SEP>One of the most imposing features of the new Hall was its tower, based on Tom Tower at Christchurch in Oxford.  The house had several grand reception rooms including a dining room, drawing room, library and morning room,  seven palatial bedrooms, three dressing rooms, two nurseries and one bathroom in addition to a boudoir and gentlemans W.C.  There were servants quarters including  four servants bedrooms, a back staircase, a lumber room and butlers pantry as well as extensive kitchens and cellarage. The large entrance hall was adorned by a vast oak staircase and contained an ancient chimney piece, allegedly from <ENT>Kenilworth<ENT> .  All of the interior decoration was carried out by Lamb & Co who were renowned for their work on Royal properties. Stained glass windows were supplied by Hardman & Co. of Birmingham.
Carnarvon<SEP>His Victoria Cross, posthumously awarded for gallantry during a beach landing at Gallipoli in April 1915, is displayed at the Royal Welch Fusiliers Museum in <ENT>Carnarvon<ENT> , Gwynedd, Wales. Damaged plating from the River Clyde can be seen in the Hampshire Regimental Museum in Winchester, England.
Lahore<SEP>Among the most popular sights are <ENT>Lahore<ENT> , adjacent to the Walled City, and home to the Sheesh Mahal, the Alamgiri Gate, the Naulakha pavilion, and the Moti Masjid. The fort along with the Shalimar Gardens has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1981.
Rock Island<SEP>The development of an armored half-track began with ordnance directive OCM 14188 to convert a M3 Scout Car into a half-track. The prototype was built at <ENT>Rock Island<ENT> with help from White Motor Company and was designated the T7. It had the same chassis and engine as the M3, but had larger front wheels and a shorter front clip. The armor consisted of 1/4 inch of hardened armor plate and it was armed with two M1919 machine guns and one M2 Browning machine gun operated by a crew of eight. Tests at Aberdeen Proving Ground in 1938 demonstrated unsatisfactory performance due to the front-wheel drive. The T7 was converted back into a scout car and returned to the Army.
Highclere<SEP>Bennett was born in Cardiff and studied at the Guildhall School of Music in London.  After graduating, she formed a band called Route 66, which performed at <ENT>Highclere<ENT> . and also sang with a jazz trio. She married businessman Bob Rae, and they had two children, Dominic and Zachary, before divorcing. Zachary was diagnosed with autism in 2006, and Bennett gave up her music career temporarily to look after him.  She took up composing again at the age of fifty, and hired a studio to record some of her pieces under her own "Fab Music" label.
Oak Ridge<SEP>During World War II he was employed as a chemist for the Manhattan Project, working at Clinton Laboratories (now <ENT>Oak Ridge<ENT> ) from 1944 to 1946. In 1945, together with Lawrence E. Glendenin and Charles D. Coryell, he isolated the previously undocumented rare earth element 61. Marinsky and Glendenin produced promethium both by extraction from fission products and by bombarding neodymium with neutrons. They isolated it using ion-exchange chromatography. Publication of the finding was delayed until later due to the war. Marinsky and Glendenin announced the discovery at a meeting of the American Chemical Society in September 1947. Upon the suggestion of Coryell's wife, the team named the new element for the mythical Prometheus, who stole fire from the gods and was punished for the act by Zeus. They had also considered naming it "clintonium" for the facility where it was isolated.
Harzburg<SEP>The Salian king Henry IV had inherited the quarrels with the Saxons from his father Emperor Henry III, whose long and costly sojournments at the Imperial Palace of Goslar had annoyed the local nobles. From the start of his reign in 1065, 15-year-old Henry IV suffered numerous setbacks enforcing his Imperial authority in Saxony after the regency of his mother Agnes of Poitou. Attempts to restore the rights over the Harz forests were not received well by the Saxon freedmen, and efforts to extend the crownlands in general as well as the increased demands laid upon the fisc were opposed. A policy of building castles and supplying them with loyal, mainly Swabian officials, continued from the time of his father, fostered resentment among multiple groups. In particular, the <ENT>Harzburg<ENT> became a symbol of Imperial tyranny and was seen as impeding on traditional Saxon rights. Like his father, Henry desired to set Goslar as the fixed capital of the German Kingdom.
Salamanca<SEP>Thomas was born in Baeza in southern Spain. His parents were Don Baltasar de Avila and Dona Teresa de Herrera. While studying law at <ENT>Salamanca<ENT> (he graduated in 1583), he read some of the unpublished writings of Teresa of Avila and in 1586 he became a monk in her order.
Chernobyl<SEP>In the Watchmen sequel Doomsday Clock, Firestorm becomes a subject of controversy after claims arise stating that he was created by the American government. Firestorm profanely denounces the "Superman Theory" and insults his Russian counterpart Pozhar, much to the dismay of Martin Stein. Firestorm subsequently becomes embroiled in a fight with several Russian superheroes before appearing to inadvertently turn a crowd of civilian protesters into glass (a feat previously deemed beyond his capabilities). Firestorm flees with the body of an affected child and is found in hiding at <ENT>Chernobyl<ENT> in Ukraine by Superman. With Superman's encouragement, Firestorm returns the child to normal. Firestorm and Superman return to the affected crowd and are engaged by the Russian military. The area then becomes engulfed in an explosion of blue light.
Gallipoli<SEP>After a meeting with John Hunyadi, Voivode of Transylvania, Vlad II Dracul did not support an Ottoman invasion of Transylvania in March 1442. The Ottoman Sultan, Murad II, ordered him to come to <ENT>Gallipoli<ENT> to demonstrate his loyalty. Vlad and Radu accompanied their father to the Ottoman Empire, where they were all imprisoned. Vlad Dracul was released before the end of the year, but Vlad and Radu remained hostages to secure his loyalty. They were held imprisoned in the fortress of Eğrigöz (now Doğrugöz), according to contemporaneous Ottoman chronicles. Their lives were especially in danger after their father supported Vladislaus, King of Poland and Hungary, against the Ottoman Empire during the Crusade of Varna in 1444. Vlad II Dracul was convinced that his two sons were "butchered for the sake of Christian peace", but neither Vlad nor Radu was murdered or mutilated after their father's rebellion.
Dachau<SEP>In one week, the 10th advanced 100 miles and captured 8,000 prisoners from 26 different enemy divisions. After a four-day respite, the 10th was one of several divisions of  spearheading the Seventh Army drive under General Alexander Patch into Bavaria. With rapid night movements, the "Tigers" continually surprised the Germans. German dispatches referred to the 10th as the "Ghost Division."  As it drove into Bavaria, the division overran one of the many subcamps of <ENT>Dachau<ENT> in the Landsberg area on 27 April 1945, earning it recognition as a liberating unit.
Cosford<SEP>Bridgnorth District was, between 1974 and 2009, a local government district in Shropshire, England. Its main town was Bridgnorth and other towns in its area were Much Wenlock, Shifnal and Broseley. The villages of Albrighton and Sheriffhales as well as <ENT>Cosford<ENT> were also in the district.
Stirling<SEP>His bagpipes are now on display in The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Regimental Museum in <ENT>Stirling<ENT> , along with his service medals and the Gold Medals he won at Oban and Inverness.
Thornton<SEP>Thwaite Priory was a monastery at Welton le Marsh in Lincolnshire, England.  It was a house of Augustinian Canons Regular, dependent on <ENT>Thornton<ENT> , founded before 1440 and thought to have been dissolved before 1536.
Watts<SEP>In 2013, Brigitte moved to the Arts_District,_Los_Angeles of Los Angeles where she wrote, narrated, produced and directed a YouTube docu-series together with The Brave New Peace Campaign, which was filmed at <ENT>Watts<ENT> and throughout downtown Los Angeles, with music from Nasimiyu and War Dolphin.
San Siro<SEP>Blyth was the goalkeeping coach at Celtic, joining them in July 2005, appointed by Gordon Strachan. While Blyth was with 'the Bhoys', the club won three SPL titles, the Scottish Cup and Scottish League Cup twice, and qualified two seasons in a row for to the knockout stage of the UEFA Champions League in 2006/07 and 2007/08. This run included taking AC Milan into extra time in <ENT>San Siro<ENT> before losing to 0–1 to the eventual champions. He and Garry Pendrey left Celtic after the resignation of Gordon Strachan in May 2009. He reunited with them at Middlesbrough in May 2010.
Deptford<SEP>The name Erith comes from the Saxon ‘Earhyth’ meaning muddy landing place. It was traditionally a small port along the River Thames. In the 16th century King Henry VIII established a naval dockyard in Erith. It became a trading hub, as spices and cotton from the East Indies were delivered onto London. A naval storehouse was constructed at Erith in 1512 that was managed by the Keeper of the Kings Storehouses who was one of the Clerks of the Kings Marine a Tudor (naval administrator). . Erith Dockyard was used as an advance base for routine maintenance before ships were transferred to <ENT>Deptford<ENT> . It closed due to persistent flooding in 1521. However according to naval historian Nicholas A. M. Rodger although Erith dockyard closed it was an important center of naval administration of the English Navy from 1514 into the 1540's.
Mystic<SEP>After the war, Brilliant was purchased by the accomplished sailor Briggs Cunningham, who attempted to increase her speed by outfitting her with a larger rig. The new rig consisted of taller masts, a self-tacking forestaysail, and a Bermuda-mainsail, replacing the original gaff main. During this time, Cunningham also invented what became known as the cunningham, a tie-down for the tack (the lower, forward corner of the mainsail) that allows the sail to maintain a more efficient shape. This makes Brilliant the first boat to have the device, now standard on racing boats of all sizes. Despite his modifications, Cunningham was unable to significantly improve the Brilliant's speed and he donated her to <ENT>Mystic<ENT> in 1957.
Winchester<SEP>Unveiled in 1896, the school chapel is a basilica in form. The architect was Basil Champneys, well known for his work at the University of Oxford and <ENT>Winchester<ENT> .
Glastonbury<SEP>Nikolaus Pevsner described it as a "grand mansion of 1868–70... in a rather forbidding Tudor Gothic, asymmetrical, with two projecting wings, but given a little romance by an angled stair-turret." A feature of particular interest is an octagonal kitchen based on the Abbot's Kitchen at <ENT>Glastonbury<ENT> .
Fort Recovery<SEP>Next, Washington put General "Mad" Anthony Wayne in command of the Legion of the United States and ordered him to launch a new expedition against Western Confederacy. Wayne spent months training his troops at the army's first formal basic training facility in Legionville, Pennsylvania, in military skills, forest warfare tactics and discipline, then led them west. In late 1793, the Legion began construction of <ENT>Fort Recovery<ENT> at the location of St. Clair's defeat; and, on June 30 – July 1, 1794, successfully defended it from a Native American attack led by Little Turtle.
Orly<SEP>Many buses ply between many areas in Draveil round-the-clock on a regular basis. Fares for the buses are included in the Navigo pass. Buses from Draveil also serve Juvisy, <ENT>Orly<ENT> , Rungis International Market and other neighbouring towns. Draveil is not directly linked to the Paris Métro network. This is a result of a decision taken by the local authorities in order to keep land developers at bay and preserve the town's provincial charm.  The Paris metro network can be reached from Juvisy station, which is across the Seine.  Juvisy station has two RER lines to reach the centre of Paris within 15 minutes: RER line C and RER line D. This station is located in the neighboring commune of Juvisy-sur-Orge, 2 km (1.2 mi) from the town center of Draveil.
Shinjuku<SEP>Seiseki-sakuragaoka Station is on the Keiō Line, and is located 26.3 kilometers from the starting point of the line at <ENT>Shinjuku<ENT> . All Keiō Line services stop at the station. Along with Tama Center Station, it is one of the main gateways to the Tama New Town development.
Carnarvon<SEP>On 13 November 1911 the royal train stopped at the station and its passengers embarked in order to travel to <ENT>Carnarvon<ENT> so that the future Edward VIII could be Investitured. For the event additional temporary wooden buildings were erected and a canopy put up. The royal train stopped near the station again on 1 July 1969 for the investiture of Prince Charles. By this time, as the station was closed and demolished a temporary platform and buildings were erected.
Charing Cross<SEP>The statue of Henry Irving is located on the grounds of the National Portrait Gallery along <ENT>Charing Cross<ENT> in London, United Kingdom. It was erected on 12 May 1910 by English actors and actresses and others related to theatre in country in a campaign organized by the Irving Memorial Committee. It was installed on land donated by the City of Westminster. The Irving Society hosts a wreath-laying ceremony at the statue on 6 February each year, commemorating the actor's birth.
Arecibo<SEP>During the flyby, scientists studied Florence using <ENT>Arecibo<ENT> and the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex, and discovered that it has two moons.
Hejaz<SEP>Al-Baḥah is the name of the province as well its main city, situated in the northwestern part of Ghamed territory. The region is formed of mountains, hills, plains, valleys and desert stretches. This region is situated in <ENT>Hejaz<ENT> , between longitudes 41/42 E and latitudes 19/20 N. The region covers an area about 36,000 km².
Darlington<SEP>In 1992, Hot Wheels sponsored the Trans-Am car of Jack Baldwin as he went on to win that year's championship. Hot Wheels signed a sponsorship deal in 1997 with NASCAR driver Kyle Petty and the No. 44 PE2 Motorsports car and thus began making replicas of NASCAR stock cars. Three years later, Hot Wheels joined the Craftsman Truck Series team of Carlos Contreras and the No. 12 truck. In 2004, Hot Wheels sponsored the No. 99 car of Jeff Burton for one race at <ENT>Darlington<ENT> . Six years later, the company returned to NASCAR to sponsor the No. 7 JR Motorsports car of Danica Patrick at Michigan International Speedway.
Salisbury<SEP>Harris matriculated from Oriel College, Oxford, 5 May 1831, graduated B.A. 1835, and M.A. 1837. He was fellow of All Souls' College 1835–7. In 1834 he was entered as a student of the Inner Temple, but changing his mind was ordained deacon in 1836 and priest in 1837. He acted as rector of Shaftesbury, Dorset, during 1839–40. In the latter year he was appointed to the rectory of Wilton in Wiltshire, which had attached to it the rectory of Bulbridge and the vicarage of Ditchampton. On 16 August 1841 he was nominated prebendary of Chardstock in <ENT>Salisbury<ENT> , and made a domestic chaplain to the bishop of the diocese. His health failed in 1848, when he resigned his livings. After some years of rest he became in 1856 the perpetual curate of Rownhams, Southampton, where Lord Herbert, in conjunction with the widow of Major Colt, had built a new parish church. In 1863, he succeeded the Rev. Henry Drury as archdeacon of Wiltshire, when he was also made vicar of Bremhill-with-Highway, near Chippenham. Here he remained an active parish priest and a coadjutor to his bishop until 1868, when he was nominated to the bishopric of Gibraltar, and consecrated on 1 May. His kindly manner, his gentle bearing, his knowledge of languages, and his long experience fitted him for his new duties. At Gibraltar he entered heartily into his work, of which he more than once gave an account at the meetings of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel.
Harewood<SEP>There are number of nearby historical houses within Leeds' boundaries, including <ENT>Harewood<ENT> , Lotherton Hall and Temple Newsam. Only 3 miles out of the city centre you can also find Kirkstall Abbey, one of the most complete medieval 12th century Cistercian Abbeys in Britain.
Blarney<SEP>"In the Name of the Grandfather" was directed by Ralph Sosa and was the first episode of the show to be written by Matt Marshall. Marshall pitched the idea in 2007 and the script was ready for a table read later that year, but the Writers Guild of America strike delayed work on the episode. Described by executive producer Al Jean as "an affectionate love letter to Ireland", the episode was inspired by a New York Times article about the effects of Ireland's smoking ban on pubs. Guest stars for the episode include Colm Meaney as Tom O'Flanagan, Glen Hansard as a street musician and Markéta Irglová as an Eastern European woman.  The episode contains numerous jokes about Ireland and references to Irish culture including the Giant's Causeway, <ENT>Blarney<ENT> , James Joyce, Bloomsday, leprechauns, Guinness, Riverdance, U2 and the film Once.
Stirling<SEP>Mar was made keeper of Prince Henry at <ENT>Stirling<ENT> in 1594. This led to disagreement with Anne of Denmark. In September 1595 she would not look at Mar when he was in the same room with her at Falkland Palace.
Solovki<SEP>Modern Solovetsky is essentially an adjunct of <ENT>Solovki<ENT> . The economy of the settlement heavily depends on the tourism.
Gallipoli<SEP>During World War I (1914–18) tirailleurs from North African territories served on the Western Front as well as at <ENT>Gallipoli<ENT> , incurring heavy losses. The Great Mosque of Paris was constructed afterwards in honour of the Muslim tirailleurs who had fought for France.
NYC<SEP>There was a proposed, but never-built, extension of the line toward Bayside and possibly <ENT>NYC<ENT> .
Solovki<SEP>Even though Epik had continued to support the Communist Party, after the abrupt reversion of the Soviet Ukrainization in the early 1930s, he suffered from the purges. He was arrested on 5 December 1934, accused of being a Ukrainian nationalist and a member of a secret terrorist organization. In early 1935, he was sentenced to ten years of forced labour and sent to <ENT>Solovki<ENT> in the White Sea.
Watts<SEP>Photographer Camilo José Vergara said that Tawana was "the only folk artist in the Eastern United States to have built a work comparable in scope and conception to the <ENT>Watts<ENT> of Los Angeles." Didi Barrett of the Museum of American Folk Art described Tawana and the Ark as "compelling symbols of hope and human potential in a community that has suffered a troubled past." Lynda Hartigan, former chief curator of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, said that Tawana's work "genuinely original, uncommercialized, and straight from the heart and mind..."
Orly<SEP>Mourad Dhina has been arrested the 16th of January 2012 by the French police at <ENT>Orly<ENT> while he was travelling to Geneva,.
Elsinore<SEP>The first known reference to the village of Nyrup (Nuthorp) is in a letter from Pope Alexander III dated 2 November 1178. The village belonged to Esrum Abbey until the Reformation. In 1497 it consisted of 10 farms and in 1681 of six farms and four houses. From 1674 until 1712 the residence of the forester of Kronborg County was in Nyrup. After that he resided at Gurrehus. Before Fredensborg was built, the king also had a hunting lodge at Nyrup. It was located a little north of the village. Nyrup was located at the site where the two royal roads (kongeveje) from Frederiksborg and Hirschholm Palace met before continuing to Helsingør and <ENT>Elsinore<ENT> . The village was therefore from at least the beginning of the 18th century and probably much earlier home to an inn.
Gander<SEP>The Comet 4 first flew on 27 April 1958 and received its Certificate of Airworthiness on 24 September 1958; the first was delivered to BOAC the next day. The base price of a new Comet 4 was roughly £1.14 million (£22.97 million in 2016). The Comet 4 enabled BOAC to inaugurate the first regular jet-powered transatlantic services on 4 October 1958 between London and New York (albeit still requiring a fuel stop at <ENT>Gander<ENT> , Newfoundland, on westward North Atlantic crossings). While BOAC gained publicity as the first to provide transatlantic jet service, by the end of the month rival Pan American World Airways was flying the Boeing 707 on the same route, and in 1960 the Douglas DC-8 as well. The American jets were larger, faster, longer-ranged, and more cost-effective than the Comet. After analysing route structures for the Comet, BOAC reluctantly cast about for a successor, and in 1956 entered into an agreement with Boeing to purchase the 707.
San Siro<SEP>Cana struggled for minutes in the 2014–15 season due to rivality with newly signed defenders Stefan de Vrij and Santiago Gentiletti. Cana however played full-90 minutes in the opening match of 2014–15 Serie A versus Milan, a 1–3 loss at <ENT>San Siro<ENT> . He made his 100th Lazio appearance on 7 December by entering as a substitute in the 1–2 win over Parma. He spent the majority of his 4th season in Italy on bench, recording only 20 appearances between league and cup. He left the club afterwards.
Abu Ghraib<SEP>Another point of discussion has been whether the enhanced interrogation techniques in <ENT>Abu Ghraib<ENT> and the Guantánamo Bay detainment camp constitutes torture or not. Although a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll "found that sizable majorities of Americans disagree with tactics ranging from leaving prisoners naked and chained in uncomfortable positions for hours, to trying to make a prisoner think he was being drowned.

Dachau<SEP>In the 1932 federal election, the Nazis secured 230 seats in the Reichstag, making then the largest single party but without a controlling majority. Six months later, President Paul von Hindenburg invited Hitler to become Chancellor, after which the latter cemented Nazi dominance over the government. In February 1933, Hitler convinced von Hindenburg to issue the Reichstag Fire Decree, legally suspending civil liberties. Himmler, who was newly appointed as the police chief of Munich, ordered the arrests of those he regarded as a threat to the Nazis—including journalists, labour organisers, Jewish community leaders, socialists, and communists—and their incarceration in <ENT>Dachau<ENT> . Hitler approved of Himmler's tactics and appointed him head of the political police across Germany.
Oak Ridge atomic plant<SEP>In 2008, the U.S. Agency for International Development created a web-based tool for estimating populations impacted by disasters. Called Population Explorer the tool uses land scan population data, developed by <ENT>Oak Ridge atomic plant<ENT> , to distribute population at a resolution 1 km for all countries in the world. Used by USAID's FEWS NET Project to estimate populations vulnerable to, or impacted by, food insecurity. Population Explorer is gaining wide use in a range of emergency analysis and response actions, including estimating populations impacted by floods in Central America and the Pacific Ocean tsunami event in 2009.
Dinosaur<SEP>Among the Henry Mountains area in Utah, about 1,500 m (4,900 ft) above sea level, Cretaceous and Jurassic aged shales are exposed. Another popular area of badland formations is Toadstool Geologic Park in the Oglala National Grassland located in northwestern Nebraska. <ENT>Dinosaur<ENT> in Colorado and Utah are also badlands settings, along with several other areas in southern Utah, such as the Chinle Badlands in Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. A small badland called Hell's Half-Acre is present in Natrona County, Wyoming. Additional badlands also exist in various places throughout southwest Wyoming, such as near Pinedale and in the Bridger Valley near the towns of Lyman and Mountain View, near the high Uintah Mountains. Pinnacles National Park in California also has areas of badlands, as does the Mojave Desert in eastern California.
Ascot<SEP>In The Observer's list of the "10 greatest horse races of all time," the match between Grundy and Bustino in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at <ENT>Ascot<ENT> on July 26, 1975 was ranked number two.

NYC<SEP>In the 1950s, scheduled air carrier service was provided at Dutchess County Airport by Colonial Airlines. Its service to POU in 1956 was a DC-3 aircraft from New York City's <ENT>NYC<ENT> , making an 11:50 am Monday-Friday flag stop en route to Montreal, Quebec and Ottawa, Ontario in Canada, with intermediate stops at Albany, New York, and Burlington, Vermont.
Southampton<SEP>She worked at <ENT>Southampton<ENT> between 1968 and 1973, University College London from 1974 to 82 and the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh (1982–91). From 1973 to 1987 she was a tutor, consultant, examiner, and lecturer for the Open University. In 1986, she became the project manager for the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. She was Professor of Physics at the Open University from 1991 to 2001. She was also a visiting professor at Princeton University in the United States and Dean of Science at the University of Bath (2001–04), and President of the Royal Astronomical Society between 2002 and 2004.
NYC<SEP>In 1945, AEA was awarded transatlantic rights, which covered destinations in Northern Europe with the requirement that the shipping company (American Export Lines) divest itself of control and turn the control over to another carrier, so that an airline was not controlled by a surface carrier.  Consequently, enough stock was sold to American Airlines to give them control, but the chairman of the board of AEA, J. E. Slater, remained. American Airlines was interested in acquiring AEA since it wanted to break into the overseas market, dominated at that time by PAA. The US CAB approved the acquisition of AEA by American Airlines on July 5, 1945. The La Guardia – Botwood – Shannon route was initially operated by Vought-Sikorsky flying boats using the Marine Air Terminal at <ENT>NYC<ENT> . By 1948 the airline also served Prestwick, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Berlin, Keflavik, Oslo, Copenhagen, Stockholm and Helsinki.
Habbaniya<SEP>No. 26 Squadron RAF Regiment was an RAF Regiment Field Squadron between 1951 and 2008. It was reformed in 2010 as a specialist Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Squadron initially based at RAF Honington in Suffolk. When it was a Field Squadron, it served at locations such as RAF Abu Sueir, <ENT>Habbaniya<ENT> , RAF Amman, RAF Tymbou, RAF Nicosia, RAF Changi, RAF Bicester, RAF Gutersloh and RAF Laarbruch. It took part in Operation's Granby and Desert Storm in 1990-91 and latterly it was based at RAF Waddington as a Rapier Squadron.
Brookwood<SEP>Pickthall was buried in the Muslim section at <ENT>Brookwood<ENT> in Surrey, England, where Abdullah Yusuf Ali was later buried.
Wembley<SEP>Millwall's first game back in the Championship was a 3–0 away win at Bristol City. The game had been much hyped due to City's signing of then-England goalkeeper David James. Only days after the defeat, Steve Coppell resigned as City manager. The Lions celebrated the 125th anniversary of the club on 2 October 2010, which was the closest home game date to the first fixture Millwall ever played against Fillebrook on 3 October 1885. Millwall drew 1–1 with Burnley and wore a special one-off kit for the game, made by manufacturers Macron, which bore the names of every footballer who had played for the club. Kenny Jackett celebrated five years in charge of the club in November 2012, with a 4–1 victory away at Nottingham Forest. After a strong start to the 2012–13 season, including a 13-game unbeaten run and flirting with the play-offs, Millwall finished poorly, with only five wins in the last 23 games, narrowly avoiding relegation on the last day of the season. Their poor league form coincided with reaching the semi-final of the FA Cup for the fifth time in their history. They played Wigan Athletic at <ENT>Wembley<ENT> on 14 April 2013, losing 2–0 to the eventual cup winners. Kenny Jackett resigned on 7 May 2013. He was Millwall's fourth-longest serving manager. After a month of searching, Millwall appointed St Johnstone boss Steve Lomas as their new manager on 6 June 2013. His appointment provoked mixed emotions among some supporters, due to him being a former captain of West Ham United, their biggest rival. Club record goalscorer Neil Harris returned to Millwall as a coach on 23 June 2013 after retiring as a player through injury. Millwall sacked Lomas on 26 December 2013, after winning only five of his first 22 games in charge. Harris and youth team coach Scott Fitzgerald took over as joint caretaker-managers. On 4 January 2014 Millwall lost 4–1 at Southend United in the FA Cup, a team 31 places below them in the football pyramid. Harris described the performance as a "shambles."
Auschwitz<SEP>In January 1945, Soviet and allied Polish armies undertook a massive offensive, aiming at the liberation of Poland and the defeat of Nazi Germany. Marshal Ivan Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front broke out of its Sandomierz Vistula bridgehead on 11 January and rapidly moved west, taking Radom, Częstochowa and Kielce on 16 January. Kraków was liberated on 18 January, a day after Hans Frank and the German administration fled the city. Marshal Konev's forces then advanced toward Upper Silesia, freeing the remaining survivors of <ENT>Auschwitz<ENT> on 27 January. In early February, the 1st Ukrainian Front reached the Oder River in the vicinity of Breslau.
Watertown<SEP>After Kaplan's short teaching position at Rice Institute, he went on to teach at the College of William and Mary in Virginia for one year. In 1940 he was invited by T. H. Hildebrandt to join the faculty at the University of Michigan, after he had previously attended the Topology Congress. The mathematics department at this time was diminishing due to the effects of World War II. Enrollment was down and some of the faculty had been granted leaves to do military research. When asked to record his contribution to the war effort, Kaplan mentioned teaching math exclusively to Air Force pre-meteorology students in the spring and summer of 1943, as well as teaching Navy V-12 and Army ASTP students for the majority of the academic year 1943-44. In June 1944, Kaplan worked at Brown University as a researcher in an Applied Mathematics Group for the Taylor Model Basin, <ENT>Watertown<ENT> and the Bureau of Ordnance of the Navy Department. He continued his research at Brown for 17 months. In May 1947 he outlined a curriculum for a new Lectures on Mathematics Project sponsored by the Office of Naval Research.
Oak Ridge<SEP>On November 12, 2012, the TOP500 list certified Titan as the world's fastest supercomputer per the LINPACK benchmark, at 17.59 petaFLOPS.

Dachau<SEP>Almost immediately after signing the concordat, the Nazis promulgated their sterilization law—the Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring—an offensive policy in the eyes of the Catholic Church. Days later, moves began to dissolve the Catholic Youth League. Clergy, nuns and lay leaders began to be targeted, leading to thousands of arrests over the ensuing years, often on trumped up charges of currency smuggling or "immorality". Priests were watched closely and frequently denounced, arrested and sent to concentration camps. From 1940, a dedicated Clergy Barracks had been established at <ENT>Dachau<ENT> . Intimidation of clergy was widespread. Cardinal Faulhaber was shot at. Cardinal Innitzer had his Vienna residence ransacked in October 1938 and Bishop Sproll of Rottenburg was jostled and his home vandalised.

Brookwood<SEP>In time, the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia was victorious and placed the relics in a church in <ENT>Brookwood<ENT> in Woking, with the enshrinement ceremony occurring in September 1984. The St Edward Brotherhood of monks was organized there as well. The church is now named St Edward the Martyr Orthodox Church, and it is under the jurisdiction of a traditionalist Greek Orthodox community. However, while the bones are of approximately the right date, they are of a man in his late twenties or early thirties rather than a youth in his mid teens.
Deptford<SEP>During the Tudor Period William Gonson's early career was as a private Merchant and Shipbuilder in the Royal Dockyards  before he began his naval career. He was given command of Mary Grace in April 1513 as captain. In 1523 he was appointed Clerk of Marine Causes until 1533. In 1524 he was also appointed Paymaster or Treasurer of the Navy until 1544  William was a naval administrator of the English navy for over twenty years, he also held the title of Keeper of the Storehouses at Erith Dockyard and <ENT>Deptford<ENT> from 1524 to 1537 in effect he held the posts of three of the later principle officers of the Council of the Marine. He was appointed by Henry VIII as Vice-Admiral of Norfolk and Suffolk in 1536. William eventually fell from grace and committed suicide in 1544  leaving the navy disorganized. It took two years for Henry to reorganize control and develop what became later known as 'The Navy Board'. He was probably along with William of Wrotham, and Sir Robert de Crull one of the three most important administrators of naval affairs of the English Navy prior to 1546.
